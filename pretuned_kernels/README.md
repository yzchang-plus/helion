# Helion Pretuned Kernels

This directory contains pretuned Helion kernels, benchmark shape sweeps, and
checked-in AOT heuristic files.  They are meant to be useful copy/paste starting
points for common kernel patterns while also being runnable examples for people
who want to quickly try Helion.

The checked-in heuristics let these kernels run immediately without online
autotuning.  Each entry lists the NVIDIA architecture it supports (currently
H100, B200, or both), and Helion picks the matching file at runtime.  Treat the
files as kernel recipes: copy the kernel and its local `_helion_aot_*` heuristic
into your code, then retune when your target shapes or hardware differ
materially from the included sweep.

Each kernel module has a `main()` that benchmarks against one or more named
reference baselines.

Each kernel ships with one heuristic file per supported compute capability.

Most kernels additionally benchmark against `torch.compile` of the listed
PyTorch baseline (a speedup-comparison baseline only -- correctness is checked
against the eager reference). The grouped-GEMM entries instead use the named
CUDA references in the table. The headline speedup is Helion vs the *fastest*
available baseline, and the per-kernel dropdown reports every baseline.

`grouped_gemm` compares Helion with the same pinned CUTLASS kernel. Required
device pointer tables are initialized before graph capture, and both
implementations are checked against the same pointer-target outputs before
timing.

`grouped_gemm_deepgemm` is separate because it follows DeepGEMM's BF16 packed-A
layout and official shape suite rather than the CUTLASS FP16 heterogeneous-M/N/K
suite. Its AOT flow searches only valid 4--7-stage `worklist_nm` schedules and
checks them against a PyTorch reference. It also reports cuBLAS on each logical
group while excluding aligned padding from the common correctness contract.
Both grouped benchmarks replay pre-captured graphs, clear L2 before every
measurement, warm the GPU before each case, and rotate/reverse implementation
order to reduce clock and ordering bias.

The model-region entries are fixed-capacity B200 examples. KDA decode ships ten
Kimi-K3 physical envelopes (B1/B2/B4/B8/B16 by TP8/H12 or TP16/H6). The perf
gate benchmarks H12 against vLLM's production CUDA fusion plus identical
projections; correctness also covers vLLM's H6 fallback. Decode sequence length
is absent from the signature, while mutable convolution/recurrent caches and
state-slot indices remain runtime data. A source-matched seven-launch PDL graph
separately measures the advantage from persistent cross-root scheduling.
Each Helion definition contains the complete computation in one generated
Triton kernel; the checked-in source does not import or assemble code from the
probe directory. Their benchmark baselines require vLLM and correctness is
checked before timing. Qwen executes the compiled `Qwen3DecoderLayer` with
vLLM's `auto` policy for attention and FP8 linears. Gemma likewise leaves MoE
dispatch on `auto`; its printed baseline name records the backend available in
the installed vLLM/FlashInfer build. The Qwen check compares final numerical
results against that production layer. When vLLM selects DeepGEMM, it also
rounds dynamic activation scales to UE8M0; the Helion kernel retains its FP32
activation scales, so the comparison is not instruction-for-instruction.

The model-region benchmarks measure each captured implementation sequentially,
with a fresh thermal warmup and cold-L2 samples, so one implementation's graph
does not perturb the other's measurement.

The kernels ported from vLLM (`vllm/kernels/helion/ops`) benchmark each fused
Helion kernel under CUDA graphs against a torch-native (unfused, eager)
reference; `silu_mul_fp8` ships an `sm90` heuristic only, the rest ship both
`sm90` and `sm100`.

`causal_conv1d` and `gdn_decode` are Pallas kernels with checked-in fixed
configurations rather than CUDA AOT heuristic files. Their module-level
`main()` functions run real-TPU JAX-export correctness checks. They are not
registered in the CUDA-only aggregate runner. The implementations and
baselines follow the Apache-licensed `vllm-project/tpu-inference` state-cache
contracts; `gdn_decode` currently targets `H=2` because larger recurrent-state
tiles exceed Helion's current aligned indirect-DMA VMEM plan.

## Scope

Use this directory as a collection of pretuned kernels and runnable examples.
For production code, copy the relevant kernel pattern into the application.  If
the shapes or target hardware differ from the included sweep, generate and
commit an AOT heuristic for the application's target shapes and hardware.

For AOT pretuned kernels, Helion's runtime looks for
`_helion_aot_<kernel>_cuda_sm<NN>.py` next to the kernel source file.  Helion
looks for AOT heuristic files for the current compute capability first, then
falls back to older compatible CUDA/ROCm capabilities.  For example, on
`sm120`, if no `sm120` heuristic exists, an `sm100` heuristic file can be used.

## Running benchmarks

Each kernel module has a `main()` that benchmarks the Helion kernel against its
named reference baselines across the included shape set:

```bash
cd pretuned_kernels/softmax
python softmax.py
```

The external grouped-GEMM references need explicit pinned checkouts:

```bash
export HELION_CUTLASS_GROUPED_GEMM_SOURCE=/path/to/CUTLASS/.../grouped_gemm.py
python -m pretuned_kernels.grouped_gemm.grouped_gemm

export HELION_DEEPGEMM_ROOT=/path/to/built/DeepGEMM
python -m pretuned_kernels.grouped_gemm_deepgemm.grouped_gemm_deepgemm
```

The modules report the required commits when either variable is missing; the
nightly workflow fetches, builds, and verifies those revisions automatically.

## Adding a heuristic for new hardware

These kernels ship pretuned heuristics for specific GPU architectures.  To add
another GPU, run the AOT autotune workflow on that hardware against the kernel;
the runner emits a new
`_helion_aot_<kernel>_<device>_<cc>.py` next to the kernel source, which
you commit alongside the existing one(s).  Helion picks the right one at
runtime based on the running GPU's compute capability (with fallback to
older compatible capabilities, e.g. `sm120` → `sm100`).

For a kernel whose `main()` benchmarks under CUDA graphs (`use_cudagraph()`
returns `True`, e.g. `scaled_mm` and the vLLM-ported ops), set
`HELION_BENCHMARK_CUDAGRAPH=1` for the autotune run so the autotuner benchmarks
candidate configs the same way — matching the deployment/benchmark timing
regime.

See the [Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Heuristic Tuning](../docs/deployment_autotuning.md#ahead-of-time-aot-heuristic-tuning)
section of `docs/deployment_autotuning.md` for the end-to-end workflow,
runner CLI, generated artifacts, and runtime fallback rules — including
a worked "Pretuning a kernel for new hardware" walkthrough.
