# Deployment and Autotuning

Helion’s autotuner explores a large search space which is a
time-consuming process, so production deployments should generate
autotuned configs **ahead of time**. Run the autotuner on a development
workstation or a dedicated tuning box that mirrors your target
GPU/accelerator. Check tuned configs into your repository alongside the kernel,
or package them as data files and load them with `helion.Config.load`
(see {doc}`api/config`). This keeps production kernel startup fast and
deterministic, while also giving explicit control over when autotuning
happens.

If you don't specify pre-tuned configs, Helion will autotune on the
first call for each specialization key. This is convenient for
experimentation, but not ideal for production since the first call
pays a large tuning cost.  Helion writes successful tuning results to
an on-disk cache (overridable with `HELION_CACHE_DIR`, skippable
with `HELION_SKIP_CACHE`, see {doc}`api/settings`) so repeated
runs on the same machine can reuse prior configs.  For more on
caching see {py:class}`~helion.autotuner.local_cache.LocalAutotuneCache`
and {py:class}`~helion.autotuner.local_cache.StrictLocalAutotuneCache`.

The rest of this document covers strategies for pre-tuning and deploying
tuned configs, which is the recommended approach for production workloads.

## Run Autotuning Jobs

The simplest way to launch autotuning straight through the kernel call:

```python
import torch, helion


@helion.kernel()
def my_kernel(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...


example_inputs = (
    torch.randn(1048576, device="cuda"),
    torch.randn(1048576, device="cuda"),
)

# First call triggers autotuning, which is cached for future calls, and prints the best config found.
my_kernel(*example_inputs)
```
Set `HELION_FORCE_AUTOTUNE=1` to re-run tuning even when cached configs
exist; the new result is saved back to the cache.
Use `HELION_SKIP_CACHE=1` to skip both reading and writing the cache
entirely (documented in {doc}`api/settings`).

Call `my_kernel.autotune(example_inputs)` explicitly to separate
tuning from execution (see {doc}`api/kernel`).
`autotune()` returns the best config found, which you can save for
later use.  Tune against multiple sizes by invoking `autotune` with
a list of representative shapes, for example:

```python
datasets = {
    "s": (
        torch.randn(2**16, device="cuda"),
        torch.randn(2**16, device="cuda"),
    ),
    "m": (
        torch.randn(2**20, device="cuda"),
        torch.randn(2**20, device="cuda"),
    ),
    "l": (
        torch.randn(2**24, device="cuda"),
        torch.randn(2**24, device="cuda"),
    ),
}

for tag, args in datasets.items():
    config = my_kernel.autotune(args)
    config.save(f"configs/my_kernel_{tag}.json")
```

### Direct Control Over Autotuners

When you need more control, construct autotuners
manually. {py:class}`~helion.autotuner.surrogate_pattern_search.LFBOTreeSearch` is the default
autotuner:

```python
from helion.autotuner import LFBOTreeSearch

bound = my_kernel.bind(example_inputs)
tuner = LFBOTreeSearch(
    bound,
    example_inputs,
    # Double the defaults to explore more candidates:
    initial_population=200,  # Default is 100.
    copies=10,  # Default is 5.
    max_generations=40,  # Default is 20.
)
best_config = tuner.autotune()
best_config.save("configs/my_kernel.json")
```

- Adjust `initial_population`, `copies`, or `max_generations` to trade
tuning time versus coverage, or try different search algorithms.

- Use different input tuples to produce multiple saved configs
(`my_kernel_large.json`, `my_kernel_fp8.json`, etc.).

- Tuning runs can be seeded with `HELION_AUTOTUNE_RANDOM_SEED` if you
need more reproducibility; see {doc}`api/settings`.  Note this only
affects which configs are tried, not the timing results.

## Effort Profiles and Initial Population Strategies

### Autotuning Effort

The `autotune_effort` setting controls how much work the autotuner does.
Each effort level configures the search algorithm with a different budget
and a default **initial population strategy** that determines how the
starting configs are generated:

| Effort | Initial Population Strategy | Use Case |
|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| `"none"` | N/A (no autotuning) | Development iteration — uses the default config only |
| `"quick"` | `from_best_available` (no random padding) | Fast development tuning — reuses cached configs and default, no random exploration |
| `"full"` | `from_random` | Production tuning — explores the full search space randomly |

Set the effort via the decorator or an environment variable:

```python
@helion.kernel(autotune_effort="quick")
def my_kernel(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

```bash
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_EFFORT=quick
```

The `"quick"` preset is a practical middle ground: it seeds the initial
population with the default configuration plus any matching cached configs
from prior runs, without adding random exploration.  A typical `quick` run
finishes in seconds (e.g. ~3s / ~32 configs for a simple kernel),
compared to `"full"` which generates a large random initial population
and runs many more generations (often ~10 minutes).

### Initial Population Strategies

The initial population strategy determines how the autotuner generates
its starting set of configurations before beginning the search:

- **`from_random`** (default for `"full"`): Generates a fully random
  initial population, maximizing diversity in the search space.

- **`from_best_available`** (default for `"quick"`): Seeds the initial
  population with the default configuration plus the best configs from
  previous autotuning runs found in the local cache.  When used with the
  `"full"` effort, the remainder of the population budget is filled with
  random configs.  When used with `"quick"`, only the default and cached
  configs are used (no random padding).  This strategy is useful when:

  - You are **iterating on a kernel** and want to warm-start from what
    previously worked rather than searching from scratch.
  - You are **tuning across similar problem sizes** on the same
    hardware — configs that worked for one size are often good starting
    points for another.
  - You want **incremental improvement** over multiple tuning sessions
    without repeating work already done.

  The strategy matches cached configs by hardware, specialization key,
  and structural fingerprint, so it only reuses results that are
  structurally compatible with the current kernel.  If
  `HELION_REMOTE_CACHE_BACKEND` is configured *and* the backend overrides
  the optional `list()` method, remote entries are merged in to fill the
  remaining slots up to `autotune_best_available_max_configs` (default
  20) after the local scan — see [Remote Autotune Cache](#remote-autotune-cache).

Override the default strategy for any effort level with the
`HELION_AUTOTUNER_INITIAL_POPULATION` environment variable:

```bash
# Use from_best_available with the full search budget
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_EFFORT=full
export HELION_AUTOTUNER_INITIAL_POPULATION=from_best_available
```

Related settings for `from_best_available` (see {doc}`api/settings`):

| Setting | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `autotune_best_available_max_configs` | `HELION_BEST_AVAILABLE_MAX_CONFIGS` | 20 | Maximum cached configs to seed |
| `autotune_best_available_max_cache_scan` | `HELION_BEST_AVAILABLE_MAX_CACHE_SCAN` | 500 | Maximum cache files to scan |

### Autotune budget

Set ``autotune_budget_seconds`` (or
``HELION_AUTOTUNE_BUDGET_SECONDS``) to cap autotune wall time and
return the best configuration found so far when the budget elapses:

```bash
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_BUDGET_SECONDS=300
```

```python
@helion.kernel(autotune_budget_seconds=300)
def my_kernel(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

The budget is checked between generations and during the finishing
phase. In-flight compiling and benchmarking completes before the
search stops. The default is ``None`` (no budget).

## Search Space Analysis

Helion can log a search space analysis after each autotune run (opt-in, disabled by default). This feature helps you understand:

- **Which features are being searched** — Shows enabled/disabled config keys and why (backend constraints, hardware limits, kernel properties)
- **Total search space size** — The exact combinatorial product of all search dimensions' cardinalities (an arbitrary-precision integer that can be very large; reported as ``unknown`` only when a dimension's cardinality can't be determined)
- **Coverage metrics** — How many configs were tested vs. total space
- **Per-feature exploration** — Exactly how many options of each feature were tested (e.g., "pid_type: 2/8 options tested (25.0%)")

Two verbosity levels are available:

- **Summary** (``autotune_log_search_space``) — the end-of-run report shown below.
- **Verbose** (``autotune_log_search_space_verbose``) — additionally logs each restriction *live* at ``INFO`` the moment it is applied during compilation, so you can see *why* the search space shrank as it happens. Enabling verbose implies the summary. Example live lines:

  ```
  Autotuner feature restriction: pid_type='xyz' disabled (data-dependent loop bounds require a persistent kernel ...)
  Autotuner feature restriction: tcgen05 search narrowed to validated configs (matmul kernel with CuTe tcgen05 backend)
  ```

### Configuration

Control via environment variables or settings:

```bash
# Enable search space logging (disabled by default)
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_LOG_SEARCH_SPACE=1

# Additionally log each restriction live as it is applied during compilation
# (implies HELION_AUTOTUNE_LOG_SEARCH_SPACE=1). Useful for seeing *why* the
# search space shrank, e.g. which pid_types were disabled and why.
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_LOG_SEARCH_SPACE_VERBOSE=1

# Save analysis to JSON files (also requires HELION_AUTOTUNE_LOG_SEARCH_SPACE=1).
# The kernel name and autotuner cache hash are injected into the filename stem,
# so distinct kernels/shapes write separate files instead of overwriting.
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_LOG_SEARCH_SPACE_PATH=/tmp/analysis.json
# Creates, per kernel/shape:
#   /tmp/analysis.<kernel>.<hash>.json  (search space + exploration report)
```

Or via decorator:

```python
@helion.kernel(
    autotune_log_search_space=True,
    autotune_log_search_space_verbose=True,
    autotune_log_search_space_path="/tmp/analysis.json",
)
def my_kernel(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

### Use Cases

1. **Debugging search quality** — Identify if the search algorithm is getting stuck (e.g., only testing 2 of 8 PID types)
2. **Budget tuning** — Low overall coverage suggests increasing `autotune_budget_seconds`
3. **Backend comparison** — Compare search spaces across different backends or hardware
4. **Constraint validation** — Verify that shape-dependent constraints are working as expected

See :py:mod:`helion.autotuner.search_space_logger` for API details.

## Remote Autotune Cache

Helion ships an ABC, `RemoteCacheBackend`, so the autotune cache can
be backed by any remote store (Redis, S3, HTTP service, shared
filesystem, etc.). Helion does not ship a concrete backend — you
provide the class and point Helion at it.

Useful when:

- **Teams share autotune results across machines** — one developer
  autotunes; the rest get the result without re-running the search.
- **CI/CD warm-starts production deployments** — a nightly tuning job
  populates the remote cache; runtime sees cache hits.
- **Multi-node clusters avoid duplicate autotuning** — every node hits
  the same shared cache instead of independently re-tuning identical
  kernels on identical hardware.

### Setup

Implement `RemoteCacheBackend` somewhere on your import path:

```python
from helion.autotuner.remote_cache import RemoteCacheBackend


class MyBackend(RemoteCacheBackend):
    def get(self, key: str) -> str | None: ...
    def put(self, key: str, data: str) -> None: ...
    # Optional: implement to enable warm-start lookups
    # (from_best_available / helion.from_cache pull from the remote
    # when local matches are below autotune_best_available_max_configs).
    def list(self, max_results: int | None = None): ...
```

Point Helion at it via env vars:

```bash
# Required: load the backend class.
export HELION_REMOTE_CACHE_BACKEND=mypackage.cache.MyBackend

# Optional: also write the winning config back to the remote on every
# autotune. Without this, the remote is read-only from this machine
# (warm-start still works, exact-match still hits).
export HELION_AUTOTUNE_CACHE=RemoteAutotuneCache
```

### Two layers

The two env vars are independent and address different needs:

| Goal | Env vars needed |
|------|------------------|
| Exact-match cache (skip autotuning when a previous run produced a config) | `HELION_REMOTE_CACHE_BACKEND` + `HELION_AUTOTUNE_CACHE=RemoteAutotuneCache` |
| Warm-start from remote (seed initial population from prior runs) | `HELION_REMOTE_CACHE_BACKEND` + a backend that overrides `list()` |
| Both | All of the above |

### Behavior

`RemoteAutotuneCache` is **read-through / write-through**: reads
consult the remote first and materialize hits locally; writes go to
both local disk and the remote.  Local disk remains the source of
truth on this machine, so a remote outage degrades gracefully — local
cached configs still serve hits, and `put` failures only log a warning
(the local write still succeeds).

Warm-start scans local first; if there are fewer than
`autotune_best_available_max_configs` compatible entries, it merges
remote entries (deduplicated against local) to fill the remainder.
Both sides apply the same filtering (hardware, specialization key,
`config_spec_hash`).

`StrictRemoteAutotuneCache` exists for users who want the strict key
semantics (invalidate on Helion/PyTorch/Triton source changes) — same
read-through / write-through behavior.

See {py:class}`~helion.autotuner.remote_cache.RemoteCacheBackend` for
the ABC and {py:class}`~helion.autotuner.remote_cache.RemoteAutotuneCache`
for the wrapper class.

## Deploy a Single Config

If one configuration wins for every production call, bake it into the decorator:

```python
best = helion.Config.load("configs/my_kernel.json")


@helion.kernel(config=best)
def my_kernel(x, y): ...
```

The supplied `config` applies to **all** argument shapes, dtypes, and
devices that hit this kernel. This is ideal for workloads with a single
critical path or when you manage routing externally. `helion.Config.save`
/ `load` make it easy to copy configs between machines; details live
in {doc}`api/config`.  One can also copy and paste the config from the
autotuner output.


## Deploy Multiple Configs

When you expect variability, supply a small list of candidates:

```python
candidate_configs = [
    helion.Config.load("configs/my_kernel_small.json"),
    helion.Config.load("configs/my_kernel_large.json"),
]


@helion.kernel(configs=candidate_configs, static_shapes=True)
def my_kernel(x, y): ...
```

Helion performs a lightweight benchmark (similar to Triton’s autotune)
the first time each specialization key is seen, running each provided
config and selecting the fastest.

A key detail here is controlling the specialization key, which
determines when to re-benchmark. Options include:

- **Default (`static_shapes=True`):** Helion shape-specializes on the exact
  shape/stride signature, rerunning the selection whenever those shapes
  differ. This delivers the best per-shape performance but requires all calls
  to match the example shapes exactly.

- **`static_shapes=False`:** switch to bucketed dynamic shapes. Helion
  reuses results as long as tensor dtypes and device types stay constant.
  Shape changes only trigger a re-selection when a dimension size crosses
  the buckets `{0, 1, ≥2}`. Helion also tracks whether any tensor exceeds the
  `torch.int32` indexing limit (more than ``2**31 - 1`` elements) and will
  automatically regenerate code with 64-bit indexing in that case. Use this
  mode when you need one compiled kernel to handle many input sizes, and pin
  ``@helion.kernel(..., index_dtype=torch.int64)`` if large tensors are the norm
  so you avoid an extra specialization boundary.

- **Custom keys:** pass `key=` to group calls however you like.
This custom key is in addition to the above.

As an example, you could trigger re-tuning with power-of-two bucketing:

```python
@helion.kernel(
    configs=candidate_configs,
    key=lambda x, y: helion.next_power_of_2(x.numel()),
    static_shapes=False,
)
def my_kernel(x, y): ...
```

See {doc}`api/kernel` for the full decorator reference.

## Selective Shape Specialization

The `static_shapes` setting is all-or-nothing: either every dimension is
specialized (`static_shapes=True`) or dimensions are bucketed dynamically
(`static_shapes=False`). Sometimes you want finer control - specializing
only specific dimensions while keeping others dynamic.

Helion provides two APIs for selective shape specialization:

| API | Location | Effect |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `hl.specialize()` | Inside kernel | Dimension always specialized for all calls |
| `torch._dynamo.mark_static()` | Outside kernel | Dimension specialized only for marked tensors |

### `hl.specialize()` - Internal Specialization

Use {func}`~helion.language.specialize` inside the kernel to make specific
dimensions compile-time constants. This applies to **every call** to the kernel:

```python
import torch
import helion
import helion.language as hl


@helion.kernel(static_shapes=False)
def rms_norm_fwd(
    x: torch.Tensor, weight: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 1e-5
) -> torch.Tensor:
    m, n = x.size()
    hl.specialize(n)  # hidden dimension becomes a compile-time constant
    out = torch.empty_like(x)
    for tile_m in hl.tile(m):
        x_tile = x[tile_m, :].to(torch.float32)
        x_squared = x_tile * x_tile
        mean_x_squared = torch.mean(x_squared, dim=-1)
        inv_rms = torch.rsqrt(mean_x_squared + eps)
        normalized = x_tile * inv_rms[:, None]
        out[tile_m, :] = (normalized * weight[:].to(torch.float32)).to(out.dtype)
    return out


# Every call specializes on n - different hidden sizes = different cache entries
weight_4096 = torch.randn([4096], device="cuda")
weight_2048 = torch.randn([2048], device="cuda")
result1 = rms_norm_fwd(
    torch.randn([2048, 4096], device="cuda"), weight_4096
)  # compiles for n=4096
result2 = rms_norm_fwd(
    torch.randn([1024, 4096], device="cuda"), weight_4096
)  # reuses n=4096
result3 = rms_norm_fwd(
    torch.randn([2048, 2048], device="cuda"), weight_2048
)  # compiles for n=2048
```

Use `hl.specialize()` when a dimension is performance-critical and you want
it specialized regardless of how the kernel is called.

Tensor strides can be specialized in the same way, for example
`row_stride = hl.specialize(x.stride(0))`. The stride is inlined in generated
code and included in the kernel cache key, so inputs with different layouts
compile separate variants.

### `torch._dynamo.mark_static()` - External Specialization

Use `torch._dynamo.mark_static()` **before** calling the kernel to specialize
dimensions on specific tensors. This is useful when you want the **same kernel**
to serve both dynamic and specialized code paths:

```python
@helion.kernel(static_shapes=False)
def matmul(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    m, k = x.size()
    k2, n = y.size()
    out = torch.empty([m, n], device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)
    for tile_m, tile_n in hl.tile([m, n]):
        acc = hl.zeros([tile_m, tile_n], dtype=torch.float32)
        for tile_k in hl.tile(k):
            acc = torch.addmm(acc, x[tile_m, tile_k], y[tile_k, tile_n])
        out[tile_m, tile_n] = acc.to(x.dtype)
    return out


# Dynamic call - all dimensions remain symbolic
x_dyn = torch.randn([m, k], device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
y_dyn = torch.randn([k, n], device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
result = matmul(x_dyn, y_dyn)

# Specialized call - mark specific dimensions as compile-time constants
x_opt = torch.randn([64, 128], device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
y_opt = torch.randn([128, 56], device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
torch._dynamo.mark_static(x_opt, [0, -1])  # specialize dims 0 and -1 (M and K)
torch._dynamo.mark_static(y_opt, 1)  # specialize dim 1 (N)
result = matmul(x_opt, y_opt)  # generates code with 64, 128, 56 as constants
```

This pattern enables a **single kernel definition** to serve both:
- Fully dynamic fallback paths (for rare edge-case shapes)
- Optimized hot paths (with shape constants baked into generated code)

### Combining Both APIs

The two APIs form a **union** - you can use `hl.specialize()` for dimensions
that should always be specialized, and `mark_static()` for additional
per-call specialization:

```python
@helion.kernel(static_shapes=False)
def fn(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    hl.specialize(x.size(0))  # dim 0 always specialized (internal)
    out = torch.empty_like(x)
    for tile in hl.tile(x.size()):
        out[tile] = x[tile] * 2
    return out


# mark_static on dim 1 combines with hl.specialize on dim 0
x = torch.randn([320, 640], device="cuda")
torch._dynamo.mark_static(x, -1)  # specialize dim 1 (external)
result = fn(x)  # both 320 and 640 become constants
```

### Cache Behavior

Each unique combination of specialized dimension values creates a separate
cache entry:
- Unspecialized calls share one dynamic cache entry
- Calls with `mark_static()` create entries keyed by the specialized values
- Different specialized values (e.g., `[64, 128]` vs `[48, 96]`) create separate entries

## Advanced Manual Deployment

Some teams prefer to skip all runtime selection, using Helion only as
an ahead-of-time compiler.  For this use case we provide `Kernel.bind`
and `BoundKernel.compile_config`, enabling wrapper patterns that let
you implement bespoke routing logic.  For example, to route based on
input size:

```python
bound = my_kernel.bind(example_inputs)

small_cfg = helion.Config.load("configs/my_kernel_small.json")
large_cfg = helion.Config.load("configs/my_kernel_large.json")

small_run = bound.compile_config(small_cfg)  # Returns a callable
large_run = bound.compile_config(large_cfg)


def routed_my_kernel(x, y):
    runner = small_run if x.numel() <= 2**16 else large_run
    return runner(x, y)
```

`Kernel.bind` produces a `BoundKernel` tied to sample
input types. You can pre-compile as many configs as you need using
`BoundKernel.compile_config`.  **Warning:** `kernel.bind()` specializes,
and the result will only work with the same input types you passed.

- With `static_shapes=True` (default) the bound kernel only works for the
exact shape/stride signature of the example inputs.  The generated code
has shapes baked in, which often provides a performance boost.

- With `static_shapes=False` it will specialize on the input dtypes,
  device types, and whether each dynamic dimension falls into the 0, 1,
  or ≥2 bucket.  Python types are also specialized.  For dimensions that
  can vary across those buckets, supply representative inputs ≥2 to avoid
  excessive specialization.  Just like the autotuning flow above, Helion
  records whether any tensor crosses the int32 indexing limit when
  `static_shapes=False`; explicitly set `index_dtype=torch.int64` if your
  deployment commonly exceeds that threshold to avoid recompilation.

If you need to support multiple input types, bind multiple times with
representative inputs.

Alternately, you can export Triton source with
`bound.to_triton_code(small_cfg)` to drop Helion from your serving
environment altogether, embedding the generated kernel in a custom
runtime.  The Triton kernels could then be compiled down into PTX/cubins
to further remove Python from the critical path, but details on this
are beyond the scope of this document.

## Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Heuristic Tuning

Helion's standard autotuning runs at the first call to a kernel and tunes
for the *exact* arguments seen.  That is great for development, but it
forces every cold-start invocation to pay a long tuning cost, and it does
not help when a deployed kernel needs to serve many different input shapes
without retuning each one.

The **AOT autotuning workflow** addresses both problems.  Offline, you
sweep a kernel over a representative shape set, tune each shape, then
distill the (shape → best-config) table into a small **decision-tree
heuristic**.  At runtime, the heuristic picks a tuned config for the
caller's shape in microseconds — no autotuner involved.  The pretuned
kernels under [`pretuned_kernels/`](https://github.com/pytorch/helion/tree/main/pretuned_kernels)
ship pretuned heuristic files that demonstrate this end-to-end.

### When to use AOT

- You ship Helion in a service or library that handles a wide range of
  input shapes (e.g., variable token counts in an LLM serving stack,
  variable matmul dimensions).
- You want zero-cost (or near-zero-cost) per-shape config selection at
  runtime — neither full autotuning nor a small benchmark sweep.
- You can identify a representative shape sweep at offline tuning time.
  AOT generalizes by *interpolating* the decision tree over input
  features (shape sizes, dtype, etc.); shapes outside the tuned regime
  may still pick a reasonable config but are not guaranteed optimal.

### Quick start: decorate a kernel for AOT

Use {py:func}`helion.aot_kernel` instead of
{py:func}`helion.kernel`.  The decorator wires the kernel into an
{py:class}`~helion.autotuner.aot_cache.AOTAutotuneCache`, which is what
loads the generated heuristic at runtime:

```python
import torch
import helion
import helion.language as hl


@helion.aot_kernel()
def vector_add(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    out = torch.empty_like(x)
    for tile in hl.tile(x.size(0)):
        out[tile] = x[tile] + y[tile]
    return out
```

Until you generate a heuristic, calling `vector_add` falls back to the
default Helion config and prints a one-time warning telling you to run the
AOT runner.

The decorator accepts a few extras:

- `batched=...` marks tensor dimensions whose size does not affect the
  optimal config (e.g., the batch dimension of an attention kernel), so
  the heuristic key ignores them and config selection generalizes
  across batch sizes.
- `key=fn` lets you supply a custom feature extractor when the default
  shape-feature extraction is not what you want (for example, deriving
  `(M, N, K)` from a custom argument layout).
- `collect_fn` / `measure_fn` define the input sweeps the offline
  workflow uses for each phase, so the workflow can run end-to-end from
  a single benchmark invocation.

See [`examples/aot_example.py`](https://github.com/pytorch/helion/blob/main/examples/aot_example.py)
for runnable demonstrations of each option, and
[`helion/autotuner/aot_kernel.py`](https://github.com/pytorch/helion/blob/main/helion/autotuner/aot_kernel.py)
for the full decorator reference.

### Offline workflow: collect → measure → evaluate

The AOT runner orchestrates a three-phase workflow over a benchmark
script that exercises the kernel across the shapes you care about:

```bash
python -m helion.autotuner.aot_runner -- python my_benchmark.py
```

`my_benchmark.py` is *your* script — it imports the kernel and calls it
on every shape in the sweep.  The runner re-invokes the script three
times with different `HELION_AOT_MODE` settings:

1. **`collect`** — for each unique shape, autotune the kernel from
   scratch and record `(kernel, shape, config, timing)` triples in
   `tuned_configs_<hardware_id>.json`.
2. **`measure`** — replay the benchmark with every config discovered
   during `collect`, on every shape, and record the resulting timings
   in `measurements_<hardware_id>.csv`.  This step is what lets the
   heuristic generator pick a small config subset that performs well
   *across all shapes*, not just on the shape it was originally tuned
   for.
3. **`evaluate`** — fit a decision tree over the measurement matrix
   and emit the heuristic file (see *Generated artifacts* below for
   the layout).  Each tree leaf names a config index, and the
   companion list of configs is the output of subset selection from
   the measure phase.

Useful runner flags (run `python -m helion.autotuner.aot_runner --help`
for the full list):

- `--kernel <name>` — restrict the workflow to specific kernels.
- `--output-dir <dir>` — where to drop `tuned_configs_*.json`,
  `measurements_*.csv`, and per-phase logs.
- `--threshold` / `--max-configs` — performance target for subset
  selection; trade off heuristic size vs. how close every shape gets to
  its individually-tuned best config (default: at most 10x slowdown
  vs. best, no more than 10 configs).

You can also run any phase manually if you only need one:

```bash
HELION_AOT_MODE=collect HELION_AOT_DATA_DIR=./aot_data python my_benchmark.py
HELION_AOT_MODE=measure HELION_AOT_DATA_DIR=./aot_data python my_benchmark.py
# ...then call the heuristic generator directly via aot_runner.
```

### Generated artifacts

The runner emits two kinds of output: per-run *data files* (collected
configs, raw measurements, logs) under the data directory, and the
*heuristic file* itself, which lands next to the kernel source so the
AOT cache can find it at runtime.

```
.helion_aot/                                 # default --output-dir
└── 20260505_120000_ab12cd/                  # one subdir per runner invocation
    ├── logs/
    │   ├── collect_<hardware_id>.log        # stdout/stderr of the collect phase
    │   └── measure_<hardware_id>.log        # stdout/stderr of the measure phase
    ├── tuned_configs_<hardware_id>.json     # collect output: best config per shape
    ├── measurements_<hardware_id>.csv       # measure output: timing matrix
    └── heuristic_summary_<hardware_id>.json # evaluate output: subset-selection report

<your kernel source dir>/
├── my_kernel.py                             # kernel source
└── _helion_aot_my_kernel_<device>_<cc>.py   # generated heuristic (commit this)
```

`<hardware_id>` is `<device_kind>_<sanitized_device_name>_<runtime_version>`
(e.g. `cuda_NVIDIA_B200_13.1`).  `<device>_<cc>` is the device kind and
compute capability used for runtime lookup (e.g. `cuda_sm100`,
`rocm_gfx950`).

Only the heuristic file is meant to be checked in — it is the entire
runtime artifact.  Everything under the data directory is disposable
per-run state used to build the heuristic.

### Heuristic file format

The generated heuristic file is plain Python — no JSON, no pickled
objects.  For a kernel `foo` it exposes two top-level functions:

```python
def key_foo(*args) -> int:
    """Decision-tree-derived config index for the given args."""
    ...


def autotune_foo(*args) -> dict:
    """Return the config dict for the given args."""
    _C = [
        {"block_sizes": [...], "num_warps": ...},  # config 0
        {"block_sizes": [...], "num_warps": ...},  # config 1
        # ...
    ]
    return _C[key_foo(*args)]
```

`key_foo` doubles as the runtime *cache key*: the
`AOTAutotuneCache` stores compiled artifacts keyed on its return value,
so once a config has been compiled for a given key the kernel call is
just `dict-lookup → cached compiled function`.

Because the file is plain Python, it is easy to inspect, hand-edit, or
regenerate.  Helion ignores `_helion_aot_*.py` for ruff and pyrefly so
they do not need to follow the project's lint rules.

### Runtime lookup and compute-capability fallback

At kernel-call time, `AOTAutotuneCache` looks for a heuristic file in
this order:

1. `$HELION_HEURISTIC_DIR` if set (useful for A/B-comparing heuristics
   generated under different conditions).
2. `_helion_aot_<kernel>_<device_kind>_<compute_capability>.py` next
   to the kernel's source file.
3. The same filename but with older compatible compute capabilities
   within the same device family — e.g. on `sm120`, Helion tries
   `sm120`, `sm100`, `sm90`, ... in order.  A single tuned heuristic
   can therefore serve multiple GPU generations with the same ISA.

If no file is found, the cache falls back to the kernel's default
config and prints a one-time warning naming the AOT runner.

### Pretuning a kernel for new hardware

A heuristic file is specific to one device kind + compute capability —
to add support for a new GPU, generate a fresh heuristic on that
hardware and commit it alongside any existing files.  The recipe works
for any GPU; the device-kind / compute-capability suffix is whatever
{py:class}`~helion._hardware.HardwareInfo` reports for the
target.

#### Step-by-step

1. **Get on the target GPU.**  The runner detects the device with
   `torch.cuda.get_device_capability()` (or the ROCm / XPU equivalent)
   and bakes that into the emitted filename, so this must run on the
   actual hardware you are targeting — not the laptop you happen to
   be editing on.

2. **Confirm the kernel uses `@helion.aot_kernel(...)`**
   (see *Quick start* above).

3. **Run the AOT workflow.**  Point the runner at any benchmark script
   that exercises the kernel across the shape sweep you want covered:

   ```bash
   # Tutorial example: tune layer_norm on the current GPU.
   python -m helion.autotuner.aot_runner -- python pretuned_kernels/layer_norm/layer_norm.py

   # User-authored kernel: same pattern.
   python -m helion.autotuner.aot_runner -- python my_benchmark.py
   ```

   The three phases run back-to-back.  Plan for a long wall-clock —
   `collect` runs full autotuning on every distinct shape, which is
   typically 5–15 minutes per shape on a recent GPU.

4. **Locate the emitted heuristic file.**  See *Generated artifacts* —
   the heuristic file lands next to the kernel source (e.g.
   `pretuned_kernels/layer_norm/_helion_aot_layer_norm_cuda_sm90.py`); the
   data dir holds disposable intermediates.

5. **Commit the heuristic file.**  Keep the existing pretuned files
   for other compute capabilities — the runtime picks the right one
   per GPU.

6. **Verify.**  Re-run the benchmark on the target GPU; the
   `[0s] Found cached config for <kernel>, skipping autotuning.` line
   in the output confirms the new heuristic is being used.

#### Adding shapes to the sweep

If you add new shapes to the kernel's benchmark, regenerate the
heuristic the same way — Helion does not extrapolate cleanly outside
the shapes used during `collect`/`measure`.  Tuning on a sweep that
covers the small / medium / large regimes you expect at serving time
gives the decision tree the leverage it needs to generalize within
those bounds.
