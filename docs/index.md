**Helion** is a Python-embedded domain-specific language (DSL) for
authoring machine learning kernels, designed to compile down to [Triton],
a performant backend for programming GPUs and other devices. Helion aims
to raise the level of abstraction compared to Triton, making it easier
to write correct and efficient kernels while enabling more automation
in the autotuning process.

[Triton]: https://github.com/triton-lang/triton

The name *Helion* refers to the nucleus of a helium-3 atom, while *Triton*
refers to hydrogen-3.

Helion can be viewed either as *PyTorch with tiles* or as *a higher-level Triton*. Compared to
Triton, Helion reduces manual coding effort through autotuning. Helion spends more time (approx
10 min) autotuning as it evaluates hundreds of potential Triton implementations generated
from a single Helion kernel. This larger search space also makes kernels more performance
portable between different hardware. Helion automates and autotunes over:

1. **Tensor Indexing:**

    * Automatically calculates strides and indices.
    * Autotunes choices among various indexing methods (pointers, block pointers, TensorDescriptors).
    * Supports per-operation indexing strategies for fine-grained memory access control of loads and stores.

2. **Masking:**

    * Most masking is implicit in Helion, and is optimized away when not needed.

3. **Grid Sizes and PID Calculations:**

    * Automatically determines grid sizes.
    * Autotunes multiple mappings from Program IDs (PIDs) to data tiles.

4. **Implicit Search Space Definition:**

    * Eliminates the need to manually define search configurations.
    * Automatically generates configuration flags and exploration spaces.

5. **Kernel Arguments Management:**

    * Automates the handling of kernel arguments, including tensor sizes and strides.
    * Lifts global variables and (nested) closures into kernel arguments, allowing better templating.

6. **Looping Reductions:**

    * Can automatically convert large reductions into looped implementations.

7. **Automated Optimizations:**

    * PID swizzling for improved L2 cache reuse.
    * Loop reordering.
    * Persistent kernel strategies.
    * Epilogue subtiling for matmul-heavy kernels (Blackwell GPUs).
    * Warp specialization choices, unrolling, and more.

## Example

A minimal matrix multiplication kernel in Helion looks like this:

```python
import torch, helion, helion.language as hl


@helion.kernel()
def matmul(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    m, k = x.size()
    k2, n = y.size()
    assert k == k2, f"size mismatch {k} != {k2}"
    out = torch.empty([m, n], dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)

    for tile_m, tile_n in hl.tile([m, n]):
        acc = hl.zeros([tile_m, tile_n], dtype=torch.float32)
        for tile_k in hl.tile(k):
            acc = torch.addmm(acc, x[tile_m, tile_k], y[tile_k, tile_n])
        out[tile_m, tile_n] = acc

    return out
```

The code outside the `for` loops is standard PyTorch code executed on
the CPU. It is typically used for tasks like allocating output tensors
and performing shape computations.

The code inside the `for` loops is compiled into a Triton kernel,
resulting in a single GPU kernel.  A single Helion kernel is always
compiled to exactly one GPU kernel.

The `hl.tile` function subdivides the iteration space (in this case `m` by
`n`) into tiles. These tiles are executed in parallel on the GPU. Tiling
details, such as dimensionality (1D vs 2D), tile sizes, and loop ordering,
are automatically determined by Helion's autotuner. Alternatively, these
details can be explicitly specified using the `config=` argument in
`helion.kernel`.

* The outer `for` loop is mapped onto the grid of the generated
  kernel. The grid size is determined automatically based on the chosen
  tile size.

* The inner `for` loop translates into a loop within the generated kernel,
  and its tile size is also determined automatically.

Within a Helion kernel, standard PyTorch operators (like
`torch.addmm`) are automatically mapped to Triton operations using
[TorchInductor](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/torch/_inductor).
Thus, familiarity with PyTorch means you already know most of
Helion. Helion supports a wide range of operations including pointwise
(`add`, `sigmoid`, etc.), reductions (`sum`, `softmax`, etc.), views,
and matrix multiplication operations.  Arbitrary function calls
within a Helion kernel are supported, but must be traceable with
[make_fx](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.fx.experimental.proxy_tensor.make_fx.html).

## Autotuning

The above example can be executed with:

```python
out = matmul(
    torch.randn([2048, 2048], device="cuda"), torch.randn([2048, 2048], device="cuda")
)
```

When a kernel runs for the first time, Helion initiates autotuning. A
typical autotuning session produces output similar to:

```
[0s] Starting DifferentialEvolutionSearch with population=40, generations=20, crossover_rate=0.8

[586s] Autotuning complete in 586.6s after searching 1520 configs.
One can hardcode the best config and skip autotuning with:
    @helion.kernel(config=helion.Config(block_sizes=[64, 64, 64], loop_orders=[[0, 1]], l2_groupings=[4], range_unroll_factors=[0, 1], range_warp_specializes=[None, False], range_num_stages=[0, 3], range_multi_buffers=[None, False], range_flattens=[None, None], num_warps=8, num_stages=6, indexing='block_ptr', pid_type='flat'))
```

Because autotuning can be time-consuming (around 10 minutes in the above
example), you may want to manually specify the best configuration found from
autotuning to avoid repeated tuning:

```python
@helion.kernel(
    config=helion.Config(
        block_sizes=[64, 64, 64],
        loop_orders=[[0, 1]],
        l2_groupings=[4],
        range_unroll_factors=[0, 1],
        range_warp_specializes=[None, False],
        range_num_stages=[0, 3],
        range_multi_buffers=[None, False],
        range_flattens=[None, None],
        num_warps=8,
        num_stages=6,
        indexing="block_ptr",
        pid_type="flat",
    )
)
def matmul(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

This explicit configuration skips autotuning on subsequent runs.

You can also specify multiple configurations, prompting Helion to perform
a more lightweight autotuning process:

```python
@helion.kernel(
    configs=[
        helion.Config(block_sizes=[[32, 32], [16]], num_warps=4),
        helion.Config(block_sizes=[[64, 64], [32]], num_warps=8),
    ]
)
def matmul(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: ...
```

In this case, Helion evaluates the provided configurations and selects the fastest one.

Additionally, Helion provides programmatic APIs to manage autotuning
and configurations directly from your code.

**For production deployment**, we recommend using ahead-of-time tuned configurations rather than relying on runtime autotuning. The autotuning process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it unsuitable for production environments where predictable performance and startup times are critical.

## Understanding Settings vs Config

Helion uses two distinct types of parameters when creating kernels:

### Config: GPU Execution Parameters
The examples above show **Config** parameters like `block_sizes`, `num_warps`, and `indexing`. These control **how kernels execute** on GPU hardware:

- **Performance-focused**: Determine tile sizes, thread allocation, memory access patterns
- **Autotuned**: The autotuner searches through different Config combinations to find optimal performance
- **Hardware-dependent**: Optimal values vary based on GPU architecture and problem size

### Settings: Compilation Control
**Settings** control **how kernels are compiled** and the development environment:

- **Development-focused**: Debugging output, autotuning behavior, compilation strategies
- **Not autotuned**: Remain constant across all kernel configurations
- **Environment-driven**: Often set via environment variables

Example combining both:

```python
@helion.kernel(
    # Settings: Control compilation behavior
    autotune_effort="none",  # Skip autotuning for development
    print_output_code=True,  # Debug: show generated code
    # Config: Control GPU execution (when not using default)
    # config=helion.Config(block_sizes=[64, 32], num_warps=8)
)
def debug_kernel(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Settings for Development and Debugging

When developing kernels with Helion, you might prefer skipping autotuning for faster iteration. To
do this, set the environment variable `HELION_AUTOTUNE_EFFORT=none` or use the decorator argument
`@helion.kernel(autotune_effort="none")`. **Warning:** The default configuration is slow and not intended for
production or performance testing.

To view the generated Triton code, set the environment variable `HELION_PRINT_OUTPUT_CODE=1` or include
`print_output_code=True` in the `@helion.kernel` decorator. This prints the Triton code to `stderr`, which is
helpful for debugging and understanding Helion's compilation process.  One can also use
`foo_kernel.bind(args).to_triton_code(config)` to get the Triton code as a string.

To emit a repro script that includes the Helion kernel definition, the config decorator, and a
`helion_repro_caller()` helper that recreates the runtime inputs before invoking the Helion kernel, set
`HELION_PRINT_REPRO=1` or include `print_repro=True` in the `@helion.kernel` decorator. This prints
the repro script to `stderr`, which is helpful for debugging and for sharing minimal repro on GitHub issue tracker.

To force autotuning, bypassing provided configurations, set `HELION_FORCE_AUTOTUNE=1` or invoke `foo_kernel.autotune(args,
force=True)`.

For reproducible autotuning results, set `HELION_AUTOTUNE_RANDOM_SEED=<seed>` to seed Python's random module before the search begins. You can also pass `autotune_random_seed=...` to `@helion.kernel` to control the seed per kernel.

Additional settings are available in the {doc}`api/settings` documentation. If both an environment
variable and a kernel decorator argument are set, the kernel decorator argument takes precedence, and the environment
variable will be ignored.

Enable logging by setting the environment variable `HELION_LOGS=all` for INFO-level logs, or `HELION_LOGS=+all`
for DEBUG-level logs. Alternatively, you can specify logging for specific modules using a comma-separated list
(e.g., `HELION_LOGS=+helion.runtime.kernel`).
