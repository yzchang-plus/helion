    ``block_size=32`` (which starves HBM), so the seed sizes a saturating tile from these fields
    (derived from the walker ``MemoryOpFact`` list + block-size specs, plus one graph walk).

    - ``total_numel``: product of the tiled block dims' ``size_hint``s (the problem element count,
      M*N); the occupancy / grid-saturation input.
    - ``slab_numel``: the untiled inner slab, in ELEMENTS, that full-extent ops drag per tiled element
      = ``sum(accessed_numel // total_numel)`` over those ops (flat kernel: 1 per op; rope:
      heads*head_dim). A BROADCAST operand (``bias[N]``, ``[M,1]``, stride-0) has
      ``accessed_numel < total_numel`` → amortized → excluded; an OVERSIZED operand still touches the
      full problem → counted (hence ``>=``).
    - ``storage_itemsize`` / ``compute_itemsize``: the STORAGE (HBM) and widest COMPUTE (fp32) byte
      widths that scale slab_numel into the two budgets — ``slab_numel * storage`` = bandwidth traffic,
      ``slab_numel * compute`` = register cap (compute reads the promoted dtype; a memory op knows only
      storage). NOTE: the register cap is a COARSE proxy (blind to compute temporaries), but benign —
      pointwise is memory-bound; its only jobs are relaxing the floor for a heavy slab and capping the
      transpose-conflict tile. (Mixed-dtype storage uses the max width — a minor seed approximation.)
    - ``contig_block_ids``: TILED block-ids that are the stride-1 axis of some full-extent op (from
      ``subscript_strides``, no graph walk). Row-major → the last dim (seed unchanged); transposed →
      a different dim; two+ entries = a load-vs-store CONFLICT → the seed emits a BALANCED tile.
    - ``sfu_ops``: count of transcendental (SFU) ops. SFU ops are latency-bound on a distinct unit, so
      a transcendental-heavy tile wants more warps while an all-FMA tile of the same op count does not
      — so SFU count (not total op count) drives the num_warps ramp.
    - ``gather_stride``: the widest GATHER stride any full-extent op applies to a tiled axis in
      its ADDRESS expression (``x[tile]`` → 1, ``x[2*tile.index]`` → 2). A stride-k gather
      touches k 32B sectors per useful sector, so the same useful bytes cost ~k× the requests —
      the coalescing input to the byte budget and the num_warps ramp. NOT the layout stride,
      which cannot distinguish two ops indexing one row-major tensor at different strides.
      1 means coalesced, or an address form the walk does not recognize.
    - ``max_op_slab_numel``: the LARGEST single op's untiled fan-out, vs ``slab_numel``'s SUM
      of the same quantity. Bytes ADD across ops (so the sum sizes the byte/register budgets)
      but LANES do not (separate vector instructions over the same threads), so the max is what
      bounds a num_warps starvation cap.
