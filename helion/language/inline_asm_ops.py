    """
    Execute inline assembly over a tensor. Essentially, this is map
    where the function is inline assembly.

    The input tensors args are implicitly broadcasted to the same shape.
    dtype can be a tuple of types, in which case the output is a
    tuple of tensors.

    Each invocation of the inline asm processes pack elements at a
    time. Exactly which set of inputs a block receives is unspecified,
    and a backend may fill the pack slots of one invocation with
    duplicate elements, so packed asm must compute each output slot
    from its own input slot alone (slot-independent). Input elements of
    size less than 4 bytes are packed into 4-byte registers.

    This op does not support empty dtype -- the inline asm must
    return at least one tensor, even if you don't need it. You can work
    around this by returning a dummy tensor of arbitrary type; it shouldn't
    cost you anything if you don't use it.

    Args:
        asm: assembly to run. Must match target's assembly format.
        constraints: asm constraints in LLVM format
        args: the input tensors, whose values are passed to the asm block
        dtype: the element type(s) of the returned tensor(s)
        is_pure: if true, the compiler assumes the asm block has no side-effects
        pack: the number of elements to be processed by one instance of inline assembly

    Returns:
        one tensor or a tuple of tensors of the given dtypes
