"""AST peepholes that:

1. Hoist ``x / scalar`` divisions out of inner loops when the divisor
   is loop-invariant (transitively).
2. Inline pure SSA-style ``NAME = ANOTHER_NAME`` alias chains where
   ``NAME`` is loop-invariant — letting the downstream code reference
   the loop-external root directly and dropping the redundant alias
   assignments.  This eliminates the per-iter "copy" that Helion's
   ``ast_extension`` passes routinely insert for SSA maintenance.

The CuTe softmax two-pass kernel computes ``out[k] = exp(x[k] - mi) / di``
in its second pass.  ``di`` is a single fp32 scalar per row that doesn't
change across the inner tile loop, but each inner iteration emits a
``v_12 = v_11 / di_copy_1_0`` floating-point divide.  Divides are slow
(~22 cycles on B200 vs 2 cycles for a multiply), and softmax fp16/bf16
shapes (e.g. (4096, 12672)) end up doing ~12672 divides per row per CTA.

The divide-hoist pass detects divisions inside for-loops where the
DIVISOR is loop-invariant — even when the divisor is a chain of copy
assignments (``di_copy_1 = di; di_copy_1_0 = di_copy_1``).  After
hoisting it walks outer-in so the rewrite places the reciprocal at the
OUTERMOST legal scope, avoiding cascade aliases like
``_helion_inv_div_0 = 1.0 * _helion_inv_div_1``.

A name is considered loop-invariant if:
  - It is read but never written inside the loop body, OR
  - It IS written inside the loop, but ONLY by Assign statements whose
    RHS is itself loop-invariant (transitively).

The rewrite then hoists the reciprocal computation:

    INV_DIVISOR = 1.0 / DIVISOR         # hoisted above the loop
    for OFFSET in range(...):
        ...
        QUOT = NUMERATOR * INV_DIVISOR
        ...

Multiple divisions sharing the same loop-invariant divisor share a
single reciprocal computation.

3. Share one reciprocal between ``n >= 2`` divisions by the same divisor
   VALUE inside a single straight-line block, even when the divisor is
   NOT loop-invariant (so the hoist above cannot fire).  ``swiglu_bwd``
   computes, per element and inside the unrolled vector-lane loop::

       v_9 = v_7 + v_8
       v_10 = v_7 / v_9
       v_12 = v_11 / v_9
       v_13 = v_12 / v_9

   and the scalar ``truediv`` lowering emits the full IEEE divide
   sequence (~20 SASS instructions with a BSSY/BSYNC branch) for every
   quotient.  The block-local pass rewrites this to one IEEE reciprocal
   plus one FMUL per quotient::

       v_9 = v_7 + v_8
       _helion_inv_div_0 = 1.0 / v_9
       v_10 = v_7 * _helion_inv_div_0
       v_12 = v_11 * _helion_inv_div_0
       v_13 = v_12 * _helion_inv_div_0

   Divisions are grouped by (name, SSA version): every statement that
   may rebind the divisor (including nested bodies, conservatively)
   starts a new version, so ``a / d; d = d + 1; b / d`` is left alone.
   A lone division is never rewritten (a reciprocal costs the same as
   the division it would replace).

Numerics of the two reciprocal rewrites (2 and 3) are identical: every
quotient becomes ``fl(x * fl(1 / d))`` instead of the correctly rounded
``fl(x / d)``.  With the fp32 unit roundoff ``u = 2**-24`` the relative
error versus the exact quotient is at most ``2u + u**2`` (two roundings)
instead of ``u``, i.e. below 1.5 ulp of the exact quotient, and the
result is the correctly rounded quotient or one of its two fp32
neighbours (at most 1 ulp away from the IEEE division result).  The bound
assumes ``1 / d`` is a normal fp32 value (roughly ``2**-128 < |d| <=
2**126``); outside that range the reciprocal can overflow or lose bits
where the division would not, exactly as for the loop-invariant hoist.
Both rewrites use only IEEE-rounded ``/`` and ``*`` -- no approximate or
fast-math instructions are introduced -- and neither is an autotuner knob:
the only gate is the ``HELION_DISABLE_HOIST_RECIP`` escape hatch.

The alias-DCE pass inlines chains like ``mi_copy_1 = mi`` /
``mi_copy_1_0 = mi_copy_1`` so the deepest inner-loop use can read
``mi`` directly.  This removes the per-iter "copy" instruction the SSA
maintenance otherwise leaves behind.
