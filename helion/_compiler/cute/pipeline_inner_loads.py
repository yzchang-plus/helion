"""AST peephole that software-pipelines per-iteration vec loads in CuTe
two-pass / single-pass reduction kernels.

The CuTe softmax / online-reduction inner loop currently emits::

    for tile_offset_X in range(START, END, STEP):
        for lane_X in range(LANE_REPS):
            LANE_BASE = tile_offset_X + thread_idx*V + lane_X*V
            LOAD_VAR = cute.arch.load(<addr depending on LANE_BASE>, VEC_TY)
            # ... compute body using LOAD_VAR and LANE_BASE ...

The whole iteration is data-dependent on the load result, so each warp
sees its iteration sequentially: issue load, wait for HBM to return,
compute, repeat.  At ~150-300 cycles per HBM round-trip, this is the
single largest scheduling stall on the inner loop after vec-hoist /
LICM / warp-reduce hoisting have squeezed the per-iter compute.

This pass software-pipelines the load by one stage: it pre-issues the
first iteration's load above the loop and, inside the loop body, issues
the NEXT iteration's load BEFORE the current iteration's compute body
runs::

    # Prologue: pre-issue iter 0 load
    _pipe_lane_base = START + thread_idx*V + 0*V
    _pipe_load = cute.arch.load(<addr using _pipe_lane_base>, VEC_TY)
    for tile_offset_X in range(START, END, STEP):
        for lane_X in range(LANE_REPS):
            # Snapshot current iter's prefetched values
            LANE_BASE = _pipe_lane_base
            LOAD_VAR = _pipe_load
            # Issue NEXT iter's load
            _pipe_lane_base = (tile_offset_X + STEP) + thread_idx*V + lane_X*V
            _pipe_load = cute.arch.load(<addr using _pipe_lane_base>, VEC_TY)
            # ... compute body uses LOAD_VAR + LANE_BASE (unchanged) ...

The masked-load form (``... if lane_base < N else ... idx 0``) already
guards against the speculative next-iter load reading out of bounds on
the final iteration: the mask falls through to a safe in-bounds index
0 read.

Correctness:
  * Prologue load is identical to the iter-0 load that the original
    code would have issued first thing inside the loop body.
  * Per-iter snapshot ``LOAD_VAR = _pipe_load`` is exactly the value
    issued in the prior iter's prefetch (or the prologue for iter 0).
  * The next-iter prefetch updates ``_pipe_*`` AFTER the snapshot, so
    the body reads the CORRECT (current iter's) values.
  * For the LAST iteration, the speculative prefetch reads beyond the
    end of the bounds-checked region — the masked-load form returns a
    safe in-bounds value which we never use (the loop ends after this
    iter).

The pass is conservative.  It only triggers when:

  1. A top-level ``for tile_offset in range(<int>, <int>, <int>)`` loop
     containing a single inner ``for lane in range(<int>)`` loop with
     LANE_REPS == 1.  (When LANE_REPS > 1 the prefetch update would
     corrupt the snapshot read by the next lane index in the same outer
     iter — see the in-source comment in ``_try_pipeline_one_outer_loop``.)
  2. The first two statements of the inner-lane body are a `lane_base`
     assignment (``LANE_BASE = tile_offset + ...``) followed by a
     vector load assignment (``LOAD_VAR = cute.arch.load(..., VecType)``).
  3. The load's address expression mentions LANE_BASE.
  4. The outer-loop trip count must be > 1 (otherwise there's no second
     iter to pipeline) and the loop must not be empty.

P19 (optional gate): an opt-in heuristic restricts pipelining to
loops whose body contains a **loop-carried scalar write** — an
assignment to a name that is defined in the OUTER scope before the
loop (a reduction accumulator like ``mi``/``di``).  This is the
structural marker that the load feeds a per-iter dependency chain
the SASS scheduler can't overlap on its own.

For pure stream-store sweeps (e.g. the consume sweep of two-pass
softmax), the SASS scheduler can already overlap consecutive iter
loads since slow ops like ``exp``/``div`` provide latency room.
In the standard microbench (5248/10240/12672/16384) pipelining
the consume sweep still measures slightly faster at the GPU level
than skipping it, so the gate is OFF by default.

The gate is provided as an opt-in for autotuner sweeps that want
to explore the "carried-only" alternative when a specific shape
shows a wall-clock regression that the default pipeline misses.

Set ``HELION_DISABLE_LOAD_PIPELINE=1`` to skip the pass entirely.
Set ``HELION_LOAD_PIPELINE_CARRIED_ONLY=1`` to enable the P19 gate
(only pipeline loops with a loop-carried scalar write).
Set ``HELION_LOAD_PIPELINE_ALL=1`` to force-disable the gate even
when the carried-only env var is set (used in test/debug scripts).

    ``constexpr_values`` maps module-level constexpr names (e.g.

    count can be resolved.

    ``dynamic_trip_counts`` maps the offset variable (loop target) of a
    rolled reduction over a symbolic extent to ``(size_hint_trips,
    constexpr_name)``; the hint stands in for the static trip count of
    ``range(0, extent, step)``.

    runs BEFORE ``ast_rename`` collapses those aliases, so the
    loop-carried-write gate uses this map to identify reduction
    accumulator writes whose pre-rename target is an alias.  Without
    this, the gate would mis-classify the softmax reduce sweep as
    having no loop-carried write and skip pipelining.
