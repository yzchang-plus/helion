"""Distribute a CuTe grid body over the synthetic lane loops it depends on.

``DeviceGridState.wrap_body`` nests every lane loop of a root body around the
whole body.  Each lane loop emulates one SIMD tile axis (a persistent
reduction's synthetic per-thread lanes, a tile block's per-thread elements),
so a statement that reads none of a loop's lane coordinates computes the same
values in every iteration of that loop.  Running it once, in program order,
outside the loop is exactly the tile program's meaning; running it inside
multiplies its work by the trip count.  ``concat2d_dim1_simple`` copies two
full slices of different widths in separate statements: with the second
slice's lane loop around the whole body, the first copy ran once per lane of
the second (27x the traffic at 2048 x (512 + 768)).

``distribute_lane_loops`` places every statement inside exactly the lane loops
whose coordinates it depends on, transitively through the names it reads and
through every definition of a name it writes (a per-lane accumulator keeps
its per-lane initialization).  Each lane loop is materialized once.  A
statement outside a loop is emitted before the loop when a later statement
inside depends on it, and after the loop when it depends on an earlier
statement inside; register and per-tensor memory dependences keep their
source order.  An atomic read-modify-write whose address names its tensor is
placed like a store: it depends on the lanes its address and value read and
its tensor orders it against every other access of that tensor.  It is never
repeated: when it runs inside a loop its values ignore (below), it is pinned
to the loop's first lane if the atomic is uniform along that loop's tile axis
(``cute/atomic_ops.py`` records those loops on the call: the leader thread's
first element is the tile's first, always in range), and the body is rejected
otherwise.  A relaxed
atomic crosses accesses of other tensors; an acquire or release one orders
every memory access against itself.  A statement with effects the pass cannot
see whole (a barrier, a helper call of unknown purity, an atomic through a
pointer alias) is pinned inside every lane loop and orders every statement
that touches memory against itself; a pure register computation sharing no
local name with it (a constant, an index expression) crosses it, so
lane-invariant neighbours may still leave the loops around it.

A vectorized lane loop also emits statements of its own around the body
(``LaneScope.attached``: the per-thread lane base, the packet loads hoisted
above the constexpr V-loop, the store flushes after it).  Each belongs to
the sites inside the loop that share with it a name the loop defines (the
packet a hoisted load binds, the buffer a flush reads), so a statement moved
across the loop with a register or memory dependence on one of them keeps
its side of those sites.  A statement moved across an outer loop also
crosses the attached statements of every loop nested in that outer loop's
instance.  A loop whose attached statements read an outer loop's values (a
packet load addressed by the outer lane's row index) nests inside that loop,
and so does every statement inside it, whether or not its own values change
with the outer loop; so does a loop that shares a statement with an outer
loop, since each loop is materialized once (the statements that need only
the inner loop then run inside the outer one too, rather than the whole
body running inside every loop).  A partial tile guards every access with
the masks of all its axes, so a statement whose address never changes with a
loop still reads the loop's mask and is placed inside it (a ``tile.begin``
access carries no lane mask).  Each statement therefore carries two lane
sets: the loops it is placed in, and the loops its values depend on, which
ignore the masks (a mask only skips the statement in the iterations past the
tile's end).

The transform fails closed.  A body containing compiler markers (lane
reductions, branch-local vector loads: the passes expanding them match the
full nest) keeps the original full nest.  When a statement has ordering
conflicts on both sides of a loop, or a loop's single instance would have to
sit on both sides of another, the
full nest is kept.  Whichever nest is emitted, the placement or the original
one, is checked the same way: each of its loops repeats every statement it
runs whose values do not depend on it once per iteration, which is the tile
program's meaning only when the repetition is idempotent and no access to
the same tensor interleaves with it in an order the repetition changes: a
lane-invariant atomic accumulates once per iteration, an invariant store that
a later per-lane store overwrites is applied again by the next iteration, and
an invariant load re-reads what an earlier iteration's per-lane store wrote.
A device loop of the body whose values depend on the lane loop runs whole
once per lane, so the accesses inside it whose values do not are repeated
with every iteration of it between two repetitions: a load of a tensor the
loop stores to, or a store to one it loads or stores per lane, is observable
there in any order, the first pass's later iterations coming before the
second pass's earlier ones.
Such a body is rejected (``BackendUnsupported``) rather than compiled into a
nest that computes something other than the program, and an atomic placed in
a loop its values ignore is pinned or rejected on every path.  A placement is
not exact by construction: the statements of an inner loop nested inside an
outer one by its hoisted packets run inside the outer loop whether or not
their values change with it, so a body that would be rejected as the full
nest is rejected as a placement too.

The placement and the exactness checks reason about one thread's program
order.  The threads of the block run the same nest unsynchronized, and a
statement whose address ignores a tile axis that several threads share (a
``tile.begin`` row read beside a per-lane update of the same tensor) touches
an element another thread owns: the owner's store and the reader's load are
in the program's order only if a block-wide barrier separates them.
``add_thread_barriers`` runs on whichever nest is emitted, for the grid body
and for a device loop's, and puts ``cute.arch.sync_threads()`` between two
accesses of one tensor that threads differing along a shared axis could
reorder, at their nearest common statement list (or between a vectorized
loop's hoisted packet loads, its V-loop and its store flushes).  Every
statement list of the nest runs on every thread with the same trip counts
(the tile masks and the atomics' leader predicates guard single accesses,
never the structure), so every thread reaches the barrier.  A store whose
address and value ignore the shared axes needs none against a later load
or an identical store: each thread's own copy of it precedes its read, and
identical stores win in any order.

That analysis reads the address mappings (``cute/address_maps.py``): two
accesses of a tensor can only meet on one thread along an axis when the
equations between their per-dimension terms, translated over the thread
coordinates, the loop variables and the uniform values by inlining the
body's definitions, force the coordinate equal (a mixed-radix argument over
the coordinates' ranges, with ``a % m`` and ``a // m`` together determining
``a``).  Reading the thread's coordinate is not owning the element:
``x[t0, t1.index + 1]`` beside ``x[t0, t1]``, ``x[n - 1 - t]`` or
``x[(t + 1) % n]`` beside ``x[t]`` name another thread's element, and so does
an address computed from a value loaded from memory (a gathered row
``x[t0, perm[t1]]`` is any thread's): such accesses count as touching every
thread's elements.  Two accesses whose
tile-program regions the memory-op codegen recorded
(``HELION_ACCESS_REGIONS_ATTR``: the slices ``out[t, :n1]`` and
``out[t, n1:]``) are apart when their intervals along some dimension do not
meet, and need no barrier.  A device loop runs its body once per iteration
on every thread with nothing between the iterations, while the program
orders all of iteration j before iteration j + 1: an access whose address
ignores the loop variable (``x[t0, 0]`` inside a loop over ``tk``) meets the
previous iteration's per-thread stores of its tensor, so every pair is
checked in that order as well and, unless a barrier of the body already
separates the two within an iteration, one closes the body.  A lane loop's
iterations are one tile statement's lanes, which the program runs together
before the next statement's: an access conflicting with a store of its
tensor across the lanes of one loop (the gather of lane i + 1 and the store
of lane i touch one element; so do the shifted read ``x[t + 1]`` of one lane
and the store ``x[t]`` of the next) cannot be ordered by any barrier and is
rejected, as the loop would have to be split; only a pair whose equal terms
force the loop's own variable equal is confined to its lane (the V-loop's
variable forced equal confines a pair to a vector lane, not to a lane of the
loop around it).  A device loop inside a lane loop runs whole once per lane,
so its body's accesses of one tensor are paired the same way, with the
device loop's iteration free on both sides: the previous row's element read
per lane beside the row's store (``x[t0.index - 1, tk]`` and ``x[t0, tk]``),
or an address every lane shares beside a per-lane one, is rejected; two
accesses confined to a lane, two that never meet (only the literal bounds
of their recorded regions count there: the loop's own tile begins differ
between the iterations the passes pair), or two stores whose addresses
ignore the lane (re-applied in program order) are not.  A statement's own
stores meet each other, across the lanes' passes as across the device
loop's iterations, when the map from the instance to the element folds
(the lane or thread and the iteration summed into one index); the terms
show the fold when they know every value in them, and a map through a
value loaded per thread or per lane (a jagged tile's rows begin at an
offset loaded per row) is not modelled.  A packet
(a vector load hoisted above a V-loop, the flush of its stores) is every one
of its elements: its term along the vectorized dimension is the per-thread
base's plus the V-loop's variable, so the packet's later elements are
compared as much as its first.

Memory dependences key on the generated tensor names, as the rest of the
lane-loop lowering does: two kernel arguments that view the same storage are
not ordered against each other.  A tensor the body builds itself (the
shared-memory view of the epilogue subtile's staging, the register array
carrying a scan's prefix) is accessed by subscript: ``smem[i] = v`` is a
plain store of it and ``smem[i] += v`` a read-modify-write.  The name also
carries the stored values to the later loads of the tensor, as ``ReadWrites``
counts an in-place write (a scan's prefix loaded back in the next lane
iteration depends on that iteration through the array); only the register
self-dependence check leaves it aside.

Names are read through the device function's rename groups.  A value carried
by a nested loop is still written under its loop-output name here (``v_3``)
and only a later pass renames it to the accumulator (``acc``); reading both
as one name keeps the accumulator's initialization in the loops its updates
depend on, once per lane.

Design note: the ownership model and its proofs
-----------------------------------------------
Every check above asks one question of two accesses to one tensor with a
write among them: can two instances of them (two threads, two lanes of one
thread, two iterations of a device loop) touch one element?  Three proofs
answer it, each failing closed, and the answer decides a barrier (between
threads), a rejection (between lanes) or a barrier closing the loop's body
(between iterations).

* Ownership, from the address mappings (``cute/address_maps.py``).  Each
  address term is translated over the thread coordinates, the lane and
  V-loop variables, the device loops' iterations (``start + step *
  iteration`` from their headers) and the uniform values (a kernel
  argument, a tile offset, a shape query) by inlining the definitions
  reaching the body; a value the translation cannot follow (a loaded
  index, a name a call defines or the body defines twice) is an unknown
  integer of its own, unless a definition around the body loads it at a
  uniform address from a kernel argument nothing in view writes (not from
  a tensor made in view: a thread's register array is the thread's own):
  every thread and lane then reads that element alike before the body
  runs (a segment's start by the block's index) and it is a uniform value
  (``AddressMaps.uniform_load``).  The equations "a term of the first
  access equals the same term of the second" are solved by a mixed-radix
  argument over the variables' ranges (the thread counts, the trip counts,
  the literal loop bounds, the conjuncts ``tid < c`` and ``index < end``
  of the branches around both accesses, the latter keeping the index one
  bounded quantity when the end is a literal and making the end a radix
  of the argument when it is a uniform value (``K * row + column`` under
  ``column < K`` is one row's, whatever ``K``), each read where its branch
  stands: one around a device loop knows nothing of the loop's own
  index, one inside it around every access of a tensor bounds that
  tensor's indices for the loop as a whole; a conjunct's names are read
  as the definitions they came from left them, so a mask the nest
  defines over an index the loop redefines bounds the outer index, not
  the loop's), and the variables the
  equations force equal say what the two instances share: a thread
  coordinate (one thread's, in program order), the lane variable (one
  lane's), the iteration (one iteration's).  A packet is every element of
  its V-loop; a store-only statement is paired with itself only through
  terms that know every value.  Whatever is not forced equal counts as
  another instance's.
* Regions, from the tile program (``cute/access_regions.py``).  The
  memory-op codegen records the interval each access covers per dimension
  (``HELION_ACCESS_REGIONS_ATTR``: the slices ``out[t, :n1]`` and
  ``out[t, n1:]``); two accesses apart along some dimension never meet.
  ``_disjoint`` cancels the tile begins two statements of one body share
  (``{}``), shifts a device loop's begins by its step for a later
  iteration (``loop_shifts``), and counts literal bounds only inside a
  loop the lanes repeat whole (None), whose own begins differ between the
  iterations two passes pair.
* Order, from the accesses themselves (``_races``): two loads, two
  atomics, or a store whose address and value ignore every shared axis
  before a load or another such store need no ordering whatever the
  instances.  A metadata query of a tensor or of a slice of it
  (``t[...].shape``, ``t[...].layout``, ``t.iterator.alignment``) is no
  access at all, whatever call it feeds (``_METADATA_ATTRS``).

Known conservative cases (right programs rejected or barriered): an index
bounded by an end that is an expression (``column < ends - starts``) or
offset by a grid coordinate (a row tile ``tile_offset + tid < m`` whose
block exceeds ``m``) is not a bounded quantity, and one bounded by a
uniform value ``K`` is a radix for ``K * row + column`` alone (not for a
stride ``K - 8`` or a scaled column), so a flattened store of either
kind, or a column-major one over such a padded row tile, is rejected
under the row lanes and closes the body under row threads; a
masked load's condition (``p.load() if mask else 0``) is no branch, so a
mask bounds a store, not the load beside it; a load in a branch's test, a
while's test or a loop's header of a device loop the lanes repeat whole,
beside a store to its tensor, is rejected rather than paired across the
lanes; a packet the pass does not
recognize (a scalar ``cute.arch.load``, a load inside the V-loop, a
reduction's flush) is an access of unknown elements; regions with
symbolic bounds exempt no pair inside a repeated device loop;
``tile.end``, ``tile.count`` and tensor indices record no region; a pair
already ordered by a barrier closing an inner loop's body may get another
at the enclosing loop; a branch on a literal condition (an emitter's
``if True:`` scope) is divergent like any other, so a pair racing inside
it is rejected rather than barriered.  Known gaps (programs accepted
whose nest is not the program): a store through a value loaded per thread
or per lane (``x[base[t0] + tk.begin]``, a jagged tile's rows beginning at
an offset loaded per row) is not paired with itself, since the terms do
not model it and rejecting it would reject every jagged store (a base
every thread and lane loads alike, a segment's start by the block's
index, is modelled: ``AddressMaps.uniform_load``); a negative literal
index, which the CuTe codegen emits as the element before the row, is
modelled as emitted (a frontend issue outside this pass).

    ``items`` is the nest about to be emitted (placement items and
    ``LanePlacement`` loops, or the body statements themselves when no lane
    loop is live); ``scopes`` describes the live loops with their attached
    statements and trip counts; ``axis_sizes`` gives the launch thread count
    along each thread axis the body may address; ``definitions`` are the
    per-thread index and mask definitions around the body (the lane setup,
    the thread axes without a lane loop, the vec wrappers' lane bases) and
    ``masks`` the tile masks among them; ``constants`` the values of the
    block-size constants the loop bounds inside the body name;
    ``loop_headers`` the ``for`` statements of the device loop whose body
    the nest is (their bounds model the loop's variables across
    iterations) and of the loops around it (the enclosing device loops and
    lane loops: their variables are one value each throughout the body,
    nonnegative and below their bounds, ``AddressMaps``).  Two
    statements accessing one tensor, at least one writing it, whose threads
    may differ along an axis shared by several threads (the address
    mappings of the two accesses do not force the coordinate equal,
    ``AddressMaps.same_thread``, the indices the tile masks around each
    access bound counting as bounded, ``AddressMaps.bounds``: a uniform
    address, a gathered one, a
    neighbour's or a permuted element) get a barrier between them at their
    nearest common statement list unless ``_races`` proves the order
    immaterial or the recorded regions of their accesses are apart
    (``_disjoint``); a barrier
    already there counts.  Modifies ``items`` in place: barrier statements
    are inserted among placement items, and positions among a vectorized
    loop's wrapper statements are recorded on its ``LanePlacement.barriers``.
    A pair whose barrier would sit in control flow a thread may skip, where
    a block-wide barrier deadlocks (the body of a branch or while loop among
    the items, or the whole nest without ``allow_barriers``), is rejected
    with ``BackendUnsupported`` instead.

    Every loop of the nest runs its body once per iteration on every thread
    with nothing between the iterations.  The device loop whose body the
    nest is (``loop_variables`` names what it redefines per iteration, its
    ``for`` targets, and ``loop_body`` the statement list one iteration runs:
    ``items``, or the innermost loop's) runs its iterations one after the
    other in the program: two statements of its body, in either emission
    order and a statement with itself included on a tensor it both reads
    and writes (a device loop nested in the body holds a uniform read and a
    per-thread store of its own; its unknown effects, the tensors inside
    calls the pass cannot see through, are not ordered against its own next
    instance) or only stores to through a map the terms know whole (which
    folds between the iterations when the thread and the iteration sum into
    one index), racing as one iteration's and a later one's, need a barrier
    after the first
    within its iteration or before the second within its own; when none of
    the placed ones does, one is added at the end of the body (or right
    after the first statement, when that sits among a vectorized loop's
    wrapper statements past the body).  Only the recorded regions of the
    accesses exempt such a pair, when they cannot meet in any later
    iteration (``loop_shifts`` maps the loop's begin symbols to their step,
    ``_disjoint``), or the address mappings, when they force the thread
    equal with the loop's variables taken as differing between the two
    iterations; a uniform access whose address moves with the iteration
    may still meet the previous iteration's per-thread stores.  A lane
    loop's or V-loop's iterations are one tile statement's lanes, run
    together before the next statement's, on one thread whatever the thread
    count along its axis: such a pair, when one side writes and a gathered
    address is involved or both addresses vary with the lane without their
    equal terms forcing the loop's own variable equal, is rejected with
    ``BackendUnsupported`` instead; so is a device loop among the items,
    which each lane runs whole, whose body accesses one tensor twice (one
    statement's own load and store included, and its stores alone through
    a map the terms know whole) with a write, unless the pair is confined
    to a lane by its terms, never meets (regions count by their literal
    bounds only there), is two stores whose addresses ignore the lane, or
    is one statement's stores confined to an iteration.  A packet (a vector
    load, a store flush) is
    every one of its elements, one per iteration of its wrapper's V-loop
    (``_packets``, or the scope of the wrapper it is attached to); a packet
    outside any wrapper the pass recognizes is an access of unknown
    elements, which forces nothing.  A statement guarded by a loop's
    first-iteration predicate (a pinned atomic) has no instance in the next
    iteration and, separated by a barrier from a later one, is ordered
    before all of its lanes.
