        ``dims`` is the static launch shape, checked at codegen, with a one on
        every axis of ``symbolic_axes``; the axis is launched with its host
        constant instead (``_BLOCK_SIZE_n``, one thread per element) when the
        body reads its thread index, and the tuple goes through
        ``checked_thread_block_dims`` at launch, where the value is known.
        An axis whose index the body never reads keeps the one: more threads
        would only repeat the same work.  A leader guard
        (``cute.arch.thread_idx()[axis] == 0`` around a tile-uniform atomic)
        is not such a read: it holds for the one thread, and it is what keeps
        the atomic to one thread when the axis is launched wide.

        The body must not combine threads.  Every cross-thread construct was
        emitted for the static shape (a warp reduction over 32 column threads
        beside the symbolic row axis spans one warp only while the axis has
        one thread), so a body with any is declined rather than launched
        wrong; the reduction over the symbolic dim itself is declined by
