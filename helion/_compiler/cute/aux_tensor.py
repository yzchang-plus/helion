"""Forward FX walker that discovers auxiliary-tensor descriptors for
a tcgen05 matmul anchor.

The existing :func:`reach_tcgen05_matmul_anchors` walker in
:mod:`cute_fx_walk` walks *backward* from a store value to the set of
matmul anchors that reach it. That direction is what the store-codegen
splice needs (it has a store value, wants to know whether a tcgen05
matmul anchor exists upstream).

The productive C-input warp (``cute_plan.md`` §7.5.3.2) needs the
*opposite* direction: at MMA-codegen time, given a freshly-registered
matmul anchor, identify the auxiliary tensors that will be consumed by
downstream stores' epilogue chains. Those identities (shape, dtype, FX
node, broadcast axis) are required to allocate the SMEM ring + TMA atom
that the producer body writes into — at the same point where the
matmul plan is constructed, well before the store splice runs and
discovers the same chains backward.

This module implements that forward walk. Each descriptor records the
fields the productive-body codegen will need; multiple descriptors per
matmul are supported (chains with several aux ops, e.g.
``relu(acc + residual) + bias``).

class Tcgen05AuxTensorDescriptor:
    """One auxiliary tensor reachable from a tcgen05 matmul anchor.

    A matmul anchor's epilogue chain (as classified by
    :func:`analyze_tcgen05_unary_epilogue_chain`) can fuse multiple
    aux loads — e.g. ``(acc + residual) * bias`` produces two
    descriptors per accepted store. Each descriptor identifies one
    aux operand by:

    - ``load_node``: the FX node for the ``helion.language.load``
      call that reads the aux tensor inside the chain. Same node
      :class:`_AuxiliaryTensorLoadExpr` already carries; preserved here
      verbatim so the productive-body splice can recover the
      per-thread index expression.
    - ``host_tensor_fx_node``: the FX node for the aux tensor itself
      (``load_node.args[0]``). The host wrapper looks this up to
      build a TMA atom keyed on the runtime tensor's stride layout.
    - ``host_tensor_val``: the ``torch.Tensor`` ``meta['val']`` on
      the host tensor's FX node — the concrete shape / dtype / device
      the producer-body codegen needs at MMA-codegen time (the TMA
      atom and SMEM ring are sized from these).
    - ``broadcast_axis``: ``None`` for the exact-shape rank-2 form
      (``residual[tile_m, tile_n]``); ``1`` for the trailing-axis
      rowvec broadcast form (``bias[tile_n]``). Matches the field on
      :class:`_AuxiliaryTensorLoadExpr` so the productive body uses the
      same axis convention as the existing per-thread splice.
    - ``store_value_node``: the FX node of the store value whose
      chain produced this descriptor. One matmul may be consumed by
      several stores (a kernel that writes the same fused result to
      multiple tensors), so the descriptor is keyed both by the aux
      operand and by which store-chain it appears in. The
      productive-body codegen can use this to pair the aux SMEM
      ring with the right store-splice consumer if a future kernel
      shape produces fan-out.

    The descriptor is intentionally minimal — just the fields the
    productive body needs. Per-aux-step splice locals (var names,
    TMEM partition state, etc.) are still owned by the store-codegen
    splice (``memory_ops._codegen_cute_store_tcgen05_tile``); the
    descriptor only carries the *identity* of the aux tensor so the
    producer-side TMA atom / SMEM ring can be allocated at MMA
    codegen time. Cross-graph FX node identity (the same load node
    visible from both the matmul-codegen pre-pass and the later
    store-codegen splice) is the link between the two sides.

    """Forward walk from a tcgen05 matmul anchor to its downstream
    stores; return the auxiliary-tensor descriptors visible in those
    stores' epilogue chains.

    Implementation: enumerate every ``store`` call across the live
    codegen graphs as ``(store_node, value_node)`` pairs, dedup on
    the value node (so a value fed to multiple stores is analyzed
    once and contributes its descriptors once), run the existing
    chain analyzer on each unique value, keep the chains whose
    anchor is the matmul we were asked about, and extract a
    descriptor per accepted aux step.

    The walker is intentionally not a node-by-node forward DFS
    through ``node.users``. The analyzer is the source of truth for
    "what shapes are accepted as epilogue chains rooted at this
    matmul"; reimplementing its acceptance rules forward would
    duplicate the whitelist semantics and risk drift. Iterating
    candidate stores and running the analyzer per-value keeps the
    walker thin and correct: the only forward fact we need is the
    enumeration of stores, which is trivial across the live graphs.

    The matmul fx_node *must* be registered in
    ``DeviceFunction.cute_state.matmul_fx_nodes`` before the
    walker is called — the analyzer's carrier walker
    (:func:`walk_carrier_to_tcgen05_matmul`) reads that set to know
    where to stop. The MMA-codegen call site registers the fx_node
    first, then invokes this walker, then constructs the matmul
    plan with the descriptors.

    Returns an empty tuple when:

    - The kernel has no store invocations (unusual but possible —
      a kernel that returns its output via a path the walker does
      not see).
    - No store's chain reaches this matmul (pure matmul kernels and
      unary-only chains contribute zero descriptors).
    - The chain analyzer rejects every store's chain (loud-failure
      shapes like 3-D collapse aux, unsupported broadcast,
      reductions). The store-codegen splice will surface the same
      rejection at codegen time; the walker stays silent so an
      unrelated matmul in the same kernel still gets its
      descriptors.

    Multiple descriptors are returned in iteration order over the
    unique value nodes then iteration order within each chain's
    aux steps. The productive-body codegen consumes the tuple as
    an ordered list keyed by aux index (mirroring the existing
    ``_AuxStepRecord``-per-aux-step indexing in
    ``memory_ops._codegen_cute_store_tcgen05_tile``).

    The canonical case is the ``bf16 x int16`` GEMM, where one operand is
    ``w[tile].to(bfloat16)``: the matmul facts only see the post-cast bf16
    dtype, so the shape-structural FFI/flat-role direct-entry seed would treat
    it as a plain bf16 GEMM. But the backing load is int16, which the
    SMEM-staged tcgen05 MMA cannot TMA-load, so the dot lowers through the
    non-tcgen05 fallback that rejects the flat-role seed config. Detect the
    real operand-source dtype here (tracing through the same
    ``convert_element_type`` wrappers MMA codegen accepts) so the seed stays
    ineligible for such kernels.
