"""Shared FX-graph backward walkers for the cute store path.

Two related but distinct walks read the value-chain that reaches a
``store`` codegen call. Both descend through the same Helion FX-graph
shape (matmul inside a ``_for_loop`` body subgraph; outer graph
consumes the body via ``operator.getitem(_for_loop_node, idx)``), so
the inner-outputs index and the getitem-subgraph-hop logic live here:

- :func:`reach_tcgen05_matmul_anchors` is a broad reachability walk
  used by the loud-failure diagnostic and the store-codegen splice
  site. It descends through every input node (``_phi`` is
  transparent, both branches walked) so a value that depends on a
  tcgen05 matmul through *any* path is detected. Returns the set
  of matmul fx_nodes reached. Empty set means no matmul anchor.

- :func:`walk_carrier_to_tcgen05_matmul` is a narrow per-step walk
  used by the unary-chain classifier (:mod:`cute_epilogue`). It
  only follows ``_phi.args[1]`` (loop body output) and ``_new_var``
  / ``getitem`` passthroughs — the rest is rejected because the
  classifier needs to render the chain expression with a single
  carrier variable. ``_phi.args[0]`` (initial value, e.g.
  ``hl.zeros``) intentionally returns ``None``; the matmul is on
  the body branch.

The two semantics are genuinely distinct (reachability vs single
carrier rendering), so this module exposes both rather than
collapsing them. The shared infrastructure is the
``inner_outputs_by_graph_id`` index and the
``_for_loop`` getitem-hop helper.

    Returns one of:

    - ``("scalar", None)``: a rank-0 aux load (``scale[()]``) — the
      underlying tensor, the load result and the index list are all
      rank 0. The value is uniform over the output tile; the chain
      classifier turns it into a ``_RuntimeScalarExpr`` leaf (never an
      aux descriptor) rendered inline as one FP32 base-pointer read.
    - ``("exact", None)``: the canonical 2-D ``aux[tile_m, tile_n]``
      shape — the underlying tensor's rank equals the carrier rank,
      the load result shape matches the carrier tile shape, and the
      load's index list is exactly the carrier's tile-id symbol
      nodes in the same order. The splice site uses the existing
      partition_C → flat_divide → partition_D pipeline.
    - ``("broadcast", 1)``: a rank-1 trailing-axis broadcast aux
      load (``bias[tile_n]``). The underlying tensor's rank is 1,
      the load result shape equals the carrier tile shape's
      trailing entry, and the load's single index symbol is
      exactly ``carrier_tile_index_nodes[1]``. Only the trailing
      axis is supported because PyTorch broadcasting aligns a
      rank-1 operand to the *last* dimension of a rank-2 LHS:
      ``acc + bias[tile_m]`` is either a shape error (BM ≠ BN) or
      rowvec broadcast against the trailing axis (BM == BN). A
      user wanting M-axis (column-vector) broadcasting via a bare
      rank-1 operand must write it explicitly (``bias[tile_m][:,
      None]`` / ``.unsqueeze(-1)``); that is a separate, deferred
      pattern. See :class:`Tcgen05UnaryEpilogueChain`
      (``cute_epilogue.py``) for the splice-side broadcast-view
      contract.
    - ``("broadcast", 0)``: a rank-2 leading-axis broadcast aux
      load (``bias[tile_m, tile_n]`` where ``bias`` has shape
      ``(1, N)``). The underlying tensor's rank is 2 with a unit
      leading (M) axis, the load result shape equals the carrier
      tile shape, the load's two index symbols are exactly
      ``carrier_tile_index_nodes`` in order, and the trailing
      extent equals ``carrier_global_shape[1]``. This is the
      explicit ``[1, N]`` row-broadcast form: PyTorch broadcasts
      row 0 of the aux to every output row. The splice site builds
      the same stride-``(0, 1)`` 2-D view as the trailing-axis
      rowvec form (row 0 reused across M).
    - ``("broadcast", 2)``: a per-row column-vector broadcast aux
      load (``scale_a[tile_m, tile_n]`` where ``scale_a`` is a full
      ``(M, N)`` view with **stride 0 on the trailing (N) axis** — an
      ``unsqueeze(1).expand(M, N)`` of a per-row ``(M,)`` vector). The
      underlying tensor's rank is 2 with the carrier's global shape,
      the load result shape equals the carrier tile shape, and the
      load's two index symbols are exactly ``carrier_tile_index_nodes``
      in order. Its value depends only on ``m``, so it is uniform over
      each thread's N fragment in the T2R epilogue: the splice reads it
      as a single **scalar** per subtile (``tTR_gAux[(0,0,0,s)]``)
      rather than a vector ``.load()``, avoiding a redundant N-wide
      read. Tried before ``("exact", None)`` because a stride-0-N aux
      still has the full ``(M, N)`` underlying shape; a genuine 2-D
      residual has a non-zero trailing stride and falls through to the
      exact matcher.

    A rank-3 exact residual is accepted when its leading index is the carrier's
    leading passthrough tile. The classifier returns ``None`` for everything
    else: 3-D tensors with a different/static leading index, broadcast variants
    whose index is not the exact carrier tile-id symbol (for example,
    ``bias[tile_n + 1]``), rank mismatches, kwargs, non-default ``extra_mask`` /
    ``eviction_policy`` positions, rank-1 indexed by the carrier's
    leading-axis tile id (``bias[tile_m]`` — see above), or rank-2
    aux whose underlying shape neither equals the carrier global
    output shape nor is the ``(1, N)`` leading-broadcast form.

    Strict on ``kwargs`` (must be empty) and on the ``extra_mask``
    / ``eviction_policy`` argument positions — both must be
    ``None`` because the splice emits a plain
    ``aux_tile[indices].load()`` without forwarding either knob.

    ``carrier_tile_shape`` is the carrier's tile shape (sympy
    symbols / ints from ``meta['val'].shape``).
    ``carrier_tile_index_nodes`` is the tuple of FX symint nodes
    that index the carrier (one per tile axis) — when provided, the
    load's index list must match these node-by-node (or, for the
    broadcast kind, the single load index must equal
    ``carrier_tile_index_nodes[1]``). ``carrier_global_shape`` is
    the output tensor's full (non-tile) shape; when provided the
    broadcast classifier additionally checks that the rank-1 aux's
    extent matches the output's global size on the broadcast axis,
    closing the gap where the bias is smaller than the global axis
    but happens to be divisible by the tile extent. The exact-shape
    classifier also uses it to reject a rank-2 aux whose underlying
    shape does not equal the global output shape (e.g. a ``(1, N)``
    tensor whose per-tile load result happens to match the carrier
    tile but which broadcasts over M) so it can never be silently
    treated as a full ``[M, N]`` exact aux.
