        """Raise ``num_warps`` while the register-resident live set OVERSHOOTS the register file.

        This is Section 3's register fix-up: "estimate registers per thread from the
        register-resident live set and proposed warp count", then "for register pressure,
        increase num_warps first". A fixed point rather than one shot, because the answer feeds
        back -- raising the count both enlarges the file AND can move the accumulators out of
        it entirely by making the tcgen05 warpgroup available, so the estimate is re-asked at
        each rung.

        The ladder climbs 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8. Losing tcgen05 below a warpgroup is confirmed in
        PTX but is not itself a penalty -- at 16 KiB live, one warp on ``mma.sync`` beats four
        on tcgen05 -- and two warps is the hand-tuned answer in 11 of 18 ``chunk_cumsum_gc``
        cells, so skipping straight to a warpgroup would overshoot.

        The fit test uses the ARCHITECTURAL 255 registers per thread: the question is whether a
        config spills catastrophically, not whether occupancy is ideal. At one warp that is
        31.9 KiB, which is the bound the measured failures sit on.

        The ladder only ever RAISES, never lowers, and that direction is load-bearing rather than
        incidental: the work-based warp count this rule receives emits one warp for 48 of 75
        measured curriculum cells and scores 0.482 against the per-cell measured optimum, where
        the same cells after this rule score 0.959. Over the 47 cells it raised, 33 got faster,
        5 got slower, 9 tied, geomean 2.01x. So this is not a correction on the margin of a
        good base -- it is where the warp count is actually decided, and a rule that also lowered
        would have to re-derive the work term the ramp is trying to express.

        WHERE IT STOPS is the other half of the rule, and it is not ``MAX_NUM_WARPS``. Registers
        are a SOFT budget: overshooting them makes ptxas spill, which degrades, where
        overshooting tensor or shared memory is a hard ``OutOfResources`` at launch. So relieving
        pressure past the point where it is relieved has a real cost -- each warp doubling doubles
        registers per CTA and so HALVES how many CTAs stay resident, and for a grid over
        batch/head (every CTA an independent unit of work, barriers CTA-scoped) that buys less
        than the spill costs. Measured on ``chunk_fwd_A_diag_anchored_varlen`` at its emitted
        tile: two warps spills 38 B and holds 4 CTAs/SM, eight warps spills NOTHING and holds 1,
        and two warps is 1.75x FASTER (325 us against 570). Thread occupancy is flat at 256
        threads/SM across both, so it explains none of that gap.

        The stopping point is a warpgroup, and it comes from this file's own model rather than
        from a fitted constant: at and above one, ``_register_live_bytes`` hands the fp32
        accumulators to tcgen05, so what remains of the estimate is the part it is loosest about
        and cannot justify another doubling. Eight warps must be earned by the WORK term.

        It is read from ``cls.REG_CLIMB_MAX_WARPS``, a per-arch class attribute, and NOT tested for
        in this body: hardware selection already happened in ``is_eligible`` via
        ``HARDWARE_TARGETS``, so re-deriving the arch here -- whether by reading it directly or by
        proxying it through ``TMEM_COLUMN_BUDGET is not None`` -- duplicates a dispatch the class
        hierarchy performs and adds a second place for the two to disagree. The H100 carrier leaves
        it at ``MAX_NUM_WARPS`` because WGMMA accumulators remain register-resident, so unresolved
        pressure can still justify climbing beyond one warpgroup.

        Both halves are measured, by sweeping ``num_warps`` over 1/2/4/8 at the emitted tile for
        75 curriculum cells and scoring against each cell's own measured optimum over the 53
        where the knob moves time by at least 10% (``gate/warpsweep.py`` in the run tree):

          * climbing to a fit, ladder to eight   0.8959   <- what this rule did before
          * climbing to a fit, stop at warpgroup 0.9591
          * the hand-tuned answer key            0.9363
          * a flat overshoot tolerance of 1.35   0.9433

        Note the third line: stopping at a warpgroup scores ABOVE the hand-tuned configs. And the
        fourth is why the rule is a cap and not a tolerance -- tolerating overshoot helps, but
        every tolerance that reaches the cells wanting two warps (2.4 and up) makes the cells that
        must climb stop early and lose up to 2.1x, so the tolerance has no setting that beats
        simply refusing to climb past the warpgroup. Capping is nearly free in the other
        direction: of the 16 cells whose optimum IS eight warps, four reach it through the ramp
        anyway and the rest give up at most 9.9% (worst cell 0.901), because four against eight is
        almost flat wherever eight wins at all.

        HISTORY, because it is the point of the rule. This fix-up was implemented first against
        a live-set estimate that selected its peak step by RANK PROFILE, and that estimate could
        not do the job: it under-counted a kernel spilling 540 registers at one warp (1.33x the
        one-warp file) while over-counting one spilling none (1.51x), so the ordering inverted
        and no threshold worked. Two patches were layered over that -- a calibration divisor,
        then an unconditional two-warp floor for multi-contraction kernels -- before the defect
        was found in the SELECTOR rather than in the rule. With the peak chosen by resolved bytes
        the estimate separates cleanly (zero-spill cells at most 1.506x the one-warp file,
        spilling cells at least 2.298x, measured over 12 curriculum cells), and both patches are
        deleted: the floor's own predicate had become identical to this ladder's first rung, so
        it could never raise anything the ladder did not already raise.

        Asked of the compiler's own ``BlockSizeSource``, not inferred. That matters because
        the three kinds of axis resolve completely differently and guessing any of them
        wrong corrupts every footprint computed from it:

        * a tunable loop axis resolves to the config's entry for it;
        * an ``hl.grid`` axis is a fixed source of 1 -- one row per program -- even though
          the axis's *extent* is the whole grid;
        * a specialized axis is fixed at its full extent.

        ``overrides`` supplies candidate-owned widths, such as compiler-rolled reductions,
        that must take precedence over their fixed source.

        Inferring these from "does it have a ``block_sizes`` entry" gets the middle case
        backwards, and the error is not small: reading a pinned outer grid axis at its full
        extent (8192 rather than 1) makes every accumulator look astronomical, so the

        step selected by RANK PROFILE -- correct for a reduction's working set, where block
        sizes are not yet known, and wrong here, where they are. Selecting by rank picked a
        step holding several rank-2 loads over the step that actually holds the accumulators,
        and the resulting estimate UNDER-counted a kernel that spills 540 registers at one warp
        (43520 B against a 32640 B one-warp file) while OVER-counting one that spills none
        (49152 B). With the ordering inverted, no threshold could separate them -- which is
        what drove a calibration divisor and then a structural warp floor over a defect that
        was in the selector.

            emits zero ``tcgen05.mma`` and ``tmem_size = 0``), and below ``TCGEN05_MIN_BM``
            the dot never reaches it at any warp count;
          * loads are excluded: they are charged to the shared-memory ring, and charging them
            here would put the same bytes in two budgets;
          * a value larger than the largest register file a CTA can have is excluded, since it
            lives in HBM and the graph merely names it (a varlen packed ``[T, C, D]`` buffer
            measured 256 MiB).

        Such a dot has no K-loop: it consumes the whole extent in one shot, so the loop the
        pipeline can actually cover is the enclosing SEQUENTIAL loop (the chunk walk), and
        the existing ``_bk_and_stages`` cap ``k // bk`` degenerates. Worse, the incumbent
        occupancy model is binary -- one threshold at ``SAT_WAVES * num_sm`` switches the
        ceiling between ``SAT_MAX_STAGES`` and ``MAX_STAGES`` -- so every kernel on one side
        of it gets the same depth. Measured over the hand-tuned corpus, the right depth
        instead falls off GRADUALLY as outer parallelism rises (outer grid 32 -> 8-11
        stages, 64 -> 6-8, 96 -> 3-4, 256 -> 2-4, and >=1024 -> 2), and it is NOT a function
        of the loop length (a 16-iteration walk wants 8 while a 128-iteration walk wants
        3-4).

        The physics that produces that gradient is shared shared-memory capacity. Depth is
        bought with SMEM per CTA, and SMEM per CTA is what limits how many CTAs an SM can
        hold. When the grid cannot even fill the machine (``grid < num_sm``) there is no
        co-residency to protect and the only latency hiding available is depth, so a CTA may
        spend the whole capacity. When the grid supplies several CTAs per SM, concurrency
        already hides the latency and every extra stage evicts a CTA. So:

            share = SMEM_BUDGET / max(1, ceil(grid / num_sm))
            depth = deepest ring that fits ``share``, capped by the loop length

        This reproduces both ends of the measured range from one rule: an outer grid far
        above the machine size (a per-chunk preprocessing kernel, 1024-16384 programs) gets
        a share of a few KB and lands on the floor of 2 -- which is what the hand-tuning
        chose there -- while a 32-program recurrence gets the whole capacity and lands deep.

        The ceiling is ``HW_MAX_STAGES``, not ``MAX_STAGES``: the incumbent 6 is a hard
        ceiling that cannot express the 8 and 11 the hand-tuning selected at low
        parallelism, so leaving it in place would cap the model below the answer.

    """B200 (sm100) seed for a kernel whose contraction structure is more than one clean
    dot: FRONT END 2, consuming the composed :class:`KernelMatmulFact`.

    The single-matmul front end configures one contraction against one budget. A kernel with
    several contractions cannot be configured that way, for two independent measured reasons:

    * **A knob is shared.** Two dots' axes frequently map onto the SAME ``block_size`` entry
      (an intra-chunk kernel builds ``A = q @ k.T`` and then consumes ``A @ v``, so one knob
      is dot 1's N and dot 2's K). Whichever dot the code happens to size first wins by
      accident, so the choice has to be RANKED.
    * **The resources are shared.** Several accumulators are live at once. Sizing the tile
      off one of them under-counts tensor memory by a factor of the accumulator count:
      measured, a three-dot chunked kernel at chunk extent 256 emits a config that dies with
      ``OutOfResources: tensor memory, Required: 768, limit 512`` -- exactly three 256-column
      accumulators against a 512-column budget. That is a correctness defect, not a missed
      optimisation.

    Two phases, as the plan prescribes:

    1. **Draft construction.** Build one whole-kernel-conditioned prior per structurally
       distinct dot; for every tunable block id, rank the dots whose axis maps onto it and
       take the winner's corresponding value; then correct the kernel-global scalars
       (``num_warps``, top-level ``num_stages``) against AGGREGATE work and occupancy rather
       than any single dot's.
    2. **Resource fix-up.** Re-validate the assembled draft against whole-kernel liveness and
       spend knobs in cost order until it fits: ``num_stages`` first (pipeline depth is the
       cheapest thing to give up), then the tunable tile axes. A fixed axis is not a knob and
       is never shrunk.

    Ranking is by ``(updates a loop-carried accumulator, dynamic work, output area)``. The
    carry term leads because a dot feeding a loop-carried accumulator holds that accumulator
    resident for the entire loop, so its tile sets the kernel's whole-loop footprint; but it
    is a PREFERENCE, not an eligibility rule -- dimensions and execution count break every
    tie, and a kernel with no carried accumulator ranks purely on work.

    It declines whenever the single-matmul front end fires, so exactly one path
    seeds and supplies the execution default for any given kernel.
