        When the reduced block is mapped to a thread axis ABOVE a sibling tile
        axis (e.g. ``hl.tile([o, d])`` where ``d`` is reduced, ``d`` on
        ``thread_idx[1]`` and ``o`` on ``thread_idx[0]``), the threads that

        the reduce group is spread across warps. A plain
        ``cute.arch.warp_reduction_*`` would fold together CONSECUTIVE lanes
        (different rows). Compute the grouped/strided parameters that the
        cross-warp ``_cute_grouped_reduce_shared_two_stage`` helper needs:

        * ``pre`` — product of live thread extents on axes *below* the reduce
          axis (the sibling rows that must stay distinct);
        * ``group_span`` — ``pre`` times the reduce-axis extent (the lanes that
          form one reduction);
        * ``group_count`` — the number of independent groups in the CTA;
        * ``lane_expr`` — the linear thread index across all live thread axes.

        Returns ``None`` (so the caller keeps the plain warp-reduce / no-op
        finalize) unless the reduce group is genuinely cross-warp
        (``pre > 1`` and ``group_span`` a multiple of 32 greater than 32).
