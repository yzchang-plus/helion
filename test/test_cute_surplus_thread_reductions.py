"""A cross-thread reduction spans the launch's threads along its axis.

Sibling loop paths reuse a CUDA axis and the launch takes the widest of
them.  A narrower sibling -- a 16-row K2 ``hl.tile`` beside a 32-thread K
loop, in a kernel whose matmul keeps the SIMT tile strategies at their own
extents -- runs with surplus threads: their tile mask fails, so they hold the
identity, but they execute every collective of the body.  The per-element
strided thread reduction sized its group by the strategy's own extent, so
the surplus threads reduced among themselves: every thread of a row is meant
to hold the K2 column sum, the surplus threads held zero, and the stores all
of them issue to one address raced (2, 0 and 431 wrong elements of 16,384
across three launches of byte-identical code).  The group now spans the
launch's threads along the axis, and a lane-looped reduction over such an
axis is declined.
