"""Multi-warp one-vector-per-thread persistent row reductions (CPU codegen).

``PersistentReductionStrategy`` used to cap every synthetic-lane row to one
warp: a 1024-wide bf16 row asked to run on 128 threads with V=8 came out as a
32-thread CTA looping over 32 scalar lanes, so the one-LDG.128-per-thread shape
of the Triton kernel was unreachable.  A row whose vector width exactly covers
each thread's slice now keeps its warp-aligned thread count and combines the
per-thread V-folds once with the cross-warp two-stage shared reduce, keyed on
the full runtime thread id like the non-synthetic cross-warp path.
